        <P>(ii) An “eligible requester” includes the following:</P>

Only those services listed on that Medicare contractor's Web site on the date the request for a prior determination is made are subject to prior determination. Each contractor's list will consist of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The national list, provided by CMS, of the most expensive physicians' services (as defined in section 1848(j)(3) of the Act) included in the MPFS which are performed at least 50 times annually.</P>

        <P>(4) <E T="03">Identification of eligible services.</E> CMS will identify the number of services that are eligible for a prior determination through manual instructions consistent with the criteria established in the regulation.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Statutory procedures.</E> Under sections 1869(h)(3) through (h)(6) of the Act, the following procedures apply:</P>

        <P>(B) <E T="03">Accompanying documentation.</E> CMS may require that the request be accompanied by a description of the physician's service, supporting documentation relating to the medical necessity of the physician's service, and other appropriate documentation. In the case of a request submitted by an eligible requester who is described in section 1869(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, the Secretary may require that the request also be accompanied by a copy of the advance beneficiary notice involved.</P>

        <P>(D) <E T="03">Informing beneficiary in case of physician request.</E> In the case of a request by a participating physician or a physician accepting assignment, the process will provide that the individual to whom the physician's service is to be furnished will be informed of any determination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section (relating to a determination of non-coverage). The beneficiary will also be notified that, notwithstanding the determination of non-coverage, the beneficiary has the right to obtain the physician's service in question and have a claim submitted for the physician's service.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Binding nature of positive determination.</E> If the contractor makes the determination described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, that determination will be binding on the contractor in the absence of fraud or evidence of misrepresentation of facts presented to the contractor.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Limitation on further review</E>—(A) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Contractor determinations described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section or paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section (relating to pre-service claims) are not subject to administrative appeal or judicial review.</P>
        <P>(B) <E T="03">Decision not to seek prior determination or negative determination does not impact the right to obtain services, seek reimbursement, or appeal rights.</E> Nothing in this paragraph will be construed as affecting the right of an individual who—</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Decides not to seek a prior determination under this paragraph with respect to physicians' services; or</P>

        <P>(a) Medicare Part B pays for therapeutic hospital or CAH services and supplies furnished incident to a physician's or nonphysician practitioner's service, which are defined as all services and supplies furnished to hospital or CAH outpatients that are not diagnostic services and that aid the physician or nonphysician practitioner in the treatment of the patient, including drugs and biologicals which are not usually self-administered, if—</P>
        <P>(1) They are furnished—</P>
        <P>(i) By or under arrangements made by the participating hospital or CAH, except in the case of a SNF resident as provided in § 411.15(p) of this subchapter;</P>
        <P>(ii) As an integral although incidental part of a physician's or nonphysician practitioner's services;</P>

        <P>(iii) In the hospital or CAH or in a department of the hospital or CAH, as defined in § 413.65 of this subchapter;<PRTPAGE P="401"/>
        </P>
        <P>(iv) Under the direct supervision (or other level of supervision as specified by CMS for the particular service) of a physician or a nonphysician practitioner as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, subject to the following requirements:</P>
        <P>(A) For services furnished in the hospital or CAH, or in an outpatient department of the hospital or CAH, both on and off-campus, as defined in § 413.65 of this subchapter, “direct supervision” means that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure. It does not mean that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be present in the room when the procedure is performed;</P>

        <P>(B) Certain therapeutic services and supplies may be assigned either general supervision or personal supervision. When such assignment is made, <E T="03">general supervision</E> means the definition specified at § 410.32(b)(3)(i), and <E T="03">personal supervision</E> means the definition specified at § 410.32(b)(3)(iii);</P>
        <P>(C) Nonphysician practitioners may provide the required supervision of services that they may personally furnish in accordance with State law and all additional requirements, including those specified in §§ 410.71, 410.73, 410.74, 410.75, 410.76, and 410.77;</P>
        <P>(D) For pulmonary rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services, direct supervision must be furnished by a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy, as specified in §§ 410.47 and 410.49, respectively; and</P>
        <P>(E) For <E T="03">nonsurgical extended duration therapeutic services (extended duration services</E>), which are hospital or CAH outpatient therapeutic services that can last a significant period of time, have a substantial monitoring component that is typically performed by auxiliary personnel, have a low risk of requiring the physician's or appropriate nonphysician practitioner's immediate availability after the initiation of the service, and are not primarily surgical in nature, Medicare requires a minimum of direct supervision during the initiation of the service which may be followed by general supervision at the discretion of the supervising physician or the appropriate nonphysician practitioner. <E T="03">Initiation</E> means the beginning portion of the nonsurgical extended duration therapeutic service which ends when the patient is stable and the supervising physician or the appropriate nonphysician practitioner determines that the remainder of the service can be delivered safely under general supervision; and</P>
        <P>(v) In accordance with applicable State law.</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of partial hospitalization services, also meet the conditions of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) Drugs and biologicals are also subject to the limitations specified in § 410.129.</P>
        <P>(c) Rules on emergency services furnished to outpatients by nonparticipating hospitals are specified in subpart G of Part 424 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(d) Rules on emergency services furnished to outpatients in a foreign country are specified in subpart H of Part 424 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(e) Medicare Part B pays for partial hospitalization services if they are—</P>
        <P>(1) Prescribed by a physician who certifies and recertifies the need for the services in accordance with subpart B of part 424 of this chapter; and</P>
        <P>(2) Furnished under a plan of treatment as required under subpart B of part 424 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(f) Services furnished by an entity other than the hospital are subject to the limitations specified in § 410.42(a).</P>
        <P>(g) For purposes of this section, “nonphysician practitioner'” means a clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse-midwife.</P>

Tests not ordered by the physician who is treating the beneficiary are not reasonable and necessary (see § 411.15(k)(1) of this chapter).</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Mammography exception.</E> A physician who meets the qualification requirements for an interpreting physician under section 354 of the Public Health Service Act as provided in § 410.34(a)(7) may order a diagnostic mammogram based on the findings of a screening mammogram even though the physician does not treat the beneficiary.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Application to nonphysician practitioners.</E> Nonphysician practitioners (that is, clinical nurse specialists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) who furnish services that would be physician services if furnished by a physician, and who are operating within the scope of their authority under State law and within the scope of their Medicare statutory benefit, may be treated the same as physicians treating beneficiaries for the purpose of this paragraph.</P>

In addition, some of these tests also require either direct or personal supervision as defined in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) or (b)(3)(iii) of this section, respectively. (However, diagnostic tests performed by a physician assistant (PA) that the PA is legally authorized to perform under State law require only a general level of physician supervision.) When direct or personal supervision is required, physician supervision at the specified level is required throughout the performance of the test.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">General supervision</E> means the procedure is furnished under the physician's overall direction and control, but the physician's presence is not required during the performance of the procedure. Under general supervision, the training of the nonphysician personnel who actually perform the diagnostic procedure and the maintenance of the necessary equipment and supplies are the continuing responsibility of the physician.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Direct supervision</E> in the office setting means the physician must be present in the office suite and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure. It does not mean that the physician must be present in the room when the procedure is performed.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Personal supervision</E> means a physician must be in attendance in the room during the performance of the procedure.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Supervision requirement for RRA or RPA.</E> Diagnostic tests that are performed by a registered radiologist assistant (RRA) who is certified and registered by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists or a radiology practitioner assistant (RPA) who is certified by the Certification Board for Radiology Practitioner Assistants, and that would otherwise require a personal level of supervision as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, may be furnished under a direct level of physician supervision to the extent permitted by state law and state scope of practice regulations.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Independent diagnostic testing facility.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) Effective for diagnostic procedures performed on or after March 15, 1999, carriers will pay for diagnostic procedures under the physician fee schedule only when performed by a physician, a group practice of physicians, an approved supplier of portable x-ray services, a nurse practitioner, or a clinical nurse specialist when he or she performs a test he or she is authorized by the State to perform, or an independent diagnostic testing facility (IDTF). An IDTF may be a fixed location, a mobile entity, or an individual nonphysician practitioner. It is independent of a physician's office or hospital; however, these rules apply when an IDTF furnishes diagnostic procedures in a physician's office.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The following diagnostic tests that are payable under the physician fee schedule and furnished by a nonhospital testing entity are not required to be furnished in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) and (g) and (h) of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) Diagnostic mammography procedures, which are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
        <P>(ii) Diagnostic tests personally furnished by a qualified audiologist as defined in section 1861(ll)(3) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(iii) Diagnostic psychological testing services personally furnished by a clinical psychologist or a qualified independent psychologist as defined in program instructions.</P>
        <P>(iv) Diagnostic tests (as established through program instructions) personally performed by a physical therapist who is certified by the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties as a qualified electrophysiologic clinical specialist and permitted to provide the service under State law.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Supervising physician.</E> (1) Each supervising physician must be limited to providing general supervision to no more than three IDTF sites. This applies to both fixed sites and mobile units where three concurrent operations are capable of performing tests.</P>

        <P>(2) The supervising physician must evidence proficiency in the performance and interpretation of each type of diagnostic procedure performed by the IDTF. The proficiency may be documented by certification in specific medical specialties or subspecialties or <PRTPAGE P="408"/>by criteria established by the carrier for the service area in which the IDTF is located. In the case of a procedure requiring the direct or personal supervision of a physician as set forth in § 410.32(b)(3)(ii) or (b)(3)(iii), the IDTF's supervising physician must personally furnish this level of supervision whether the procedure is performed in the IDTF or, in the case of mobile services, at the remote location. The IDTF must maintain documentation of sufficient physician resources during all hours of operations to assure that the required physician supervision is furnished. In the case of procedures requiring direct supervision, the supervising physician may oversee concurrent procedures.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonphysician personnel.</E> Any nonphysician personnel used by the IDTF to perform tests must demonstrate the basic qualifications to perform the tests in question and have training and proficiency as evidenced by licensure or certification by the appropriate State health or education department. In the absence of a State licensing board, the technician must be certified by an appropriate national credentialing body. The IDTF must maintain documentation available for review that these requirements are met.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Ordering of tests.</E> All procedures performed by the IDTF must be specifically ordered in writing by the physician who is treating the beneficiary, that is, the physician who is furnishing a consultation or treating a beneficiary for a specific medical problem and who uses the results in the management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem. (Nonphysician practitioners may order tests as set forth in § 410.32(a)(3).) The order must specify the diagnosis or other basis for the testing. The supervising physician for the IDTF may not order tests to be performed by the IDTF, unless the IDTF's supervising physician is in fact the beneficiary's treating physician. That is, the physician in question had a relationship with the beneficiary prior to the performance of the testing and is treating the beneficiary for a specific medical problem. The IDTF may not add any procedures based on internal protocols without a written order from the treating physician.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Multi-State entities.</E> (1) An IDTF that operates across State boundaries must—</P>
        <P>(i) Maintain documentation that its supervising physicians and technicians are licensed and certified in each of the States in which it operates; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Operate in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local licensure and regulatory requirements with regard to the health and safety of patients.</P>
        <P>(2) The point of the actual delivery of service means the place of service on the claim form. When the IDTF performs or administers an entire diagnostic test at the beneficiary's location, the beneficiary's location is the place of service. When one or more aspects of the diagnostic testing are performed at the IDTF, the IDTF is the place of service.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Applicability of State law.</E> An IDTF must comply with the applicable laws of any State in which it operates.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Application certification standards.</E> The IDTF must certify in its enrollment application that it meets the following standards and related requirements:</P>
        <P>(1) Operates its business in compliance with all applicable Federal and State licensure and regulatory requirements for the health and safety of patients.</P>
        <P>(2) Provides complete and accurate information on its enrollment application. Changes in ownership, changes of location, changes in general supervision, and adverse legal actions must be reported to the Medicare fee-for-service contractor on the Medicare enrollment application within 30 calendar days of the change. All other changes to the enrollment application must be reported within 90 days.</P>
        <P>(3) Maintain a physical facility on an appropriate site. For the purposes of this standard, a post office box, commercial mailbox, hotel, or motel is not considered an appropriate site.</P>

        <P>(i) The physical facility, including mobile units, must contain space for equipment appropriate to the services designated on the enrollment application, facilities for hand washing, adequate patient privacy accommodations, and the storage of both business records and current medical records <PRTPAGE P="409"/>within the office setting of the IDTF, or IDTF home office, not within the actual mobile unit.</P>
        <P>(ii) IDTF suppliers that provide services remotely and do not see beneficiaries at their practice location are exempt from providing hand washing and adequate patient privacy accommodations.</P>
        <P>(4) Has all applicable diagnostic testing equipment available at the physical site excluding portable diagnostic testing equipment. The IDTF must—</P>
        <P>(i) Maintain a catalog of portable diagnostic equipment, including diagnostic testing equipment serial numbers at the physical site;</P>
        <P>(ii) Make portable diagnostic testing equipment available for inspection within 2 business days of a CMS inspection request.</P>
        <P>(iii) Maintain a current inventory of the diagnostic testing equipment, including serial and registration numbers and provide this information to the designated fee-for-service contractor upon request, and notify the contractor of any changes in equipment within 90 days.</P>
        <P>(5) Maintain a primary business phone under the name of the designated business. The IDTF must have its—</P>
        <P>(i) Primary business phone located at the designated site of the business or within the home office of the mobile IDTF units.</P>
        <P>(ii) Telephone or toll free telephone numbers available in a local directory and through directory assistance.</P>
        <P>(6) Have a comprehensive liability insurance policy of at least $300,000 per location that covers both the place of business and all customers and employees of the IDTF. The policy must be carried by a nonrelative-owned company. Failure to maintain required insurance at all times will result in revocation of the IDTF's billing privileges retroactive to the date the insurance lapsed. IDTF suppliers are responsible for providing the contact information for the issuing insurance agent and the underwriter. In addition, the IDTF must—</P>
        <P>(i) Ensure that the insurance policy must remain in force at all times and provide coverage of at least $300,000 per incident; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Notify the CMS designated contractor in writing of any policy changes or cancellations.</P>
        <P>(7) Agree not to directly solicit patients, which include, but is not limited to, a prohibition on telephone, computer, or in-person contacts. The IDTF must accept only those patients referred for diagnostic testing by an attending physician, who is furnishing a consultation or treating a beneficiary for a specific medical problem and who uses the results in the management of the beneficiary's specific medical problem. Nonphysician practitioners may order tests as set forth in § 410.32(a)(3).</P>
        <P>(8) Answer, document, and maintain documentation of a beneficiary's written clinical complaint at the physical site of the IDTF (For mobile IDTFs, this documentation would be stored at their home office.) This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The name, address, telephone number, and health insurance claim number of the beneficiary.</P>
        <P>(ii) The date the complaint was received; the name of the person receiving the complaint; and a summary of actions taken to resolve the complaint.</P>
        <P>(iii) If an investigation was not conducted, the name of the person making the decision and the reason for the decision.</P>
        <P>(9) Openly post these standards for review by patients and the public.</P>
        <P>(10) Disclose to the government any person having ownership, financial, or control interest or any other legal interest in the supplier at the time of enrollment or within 30 days of a change.</P>
        <P>(11) Have its testing equipment calibrated and maintained per equipment instructions and in compliance with applicable manufacturers suggested maintenance and calibration standards.</P>
        <P>(12) Have technical staff on duty with the appropriate credentials to perform tests. The IDTF must be able to produce the applicable Federal or State licenses or certifications of the individuals performing these services.</P>

        <P>(13) Have proper medical record storage and be able to retrieve medical records upon request from CMS or its fee-for-service contractor within 2 business days.<PRTPAGE P="410"/>
        </P>
        <P>(14) Permit CMS, including its agents, or its designated fee-for-service contractors, to conduct unannounced, on-site inspections to confirm the IDTF's compliance with these standards. The IDTF must—</P>
        <P>(i) Be accessible during regular business hours to CMS and beneficiaries; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Maintain a visible sign posting its normal business hours.</P>
        <P>(15) With the exception of hospital-based and mobile IDTFs, a fixed-base IDTF is prohibited from the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Sharing a practice location with another Medicare-enrolled individual or organization;</P>
        <P>(ii) Leasing or subleasing its operations or its practice location to another Medicare-enrolled individual or organization; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Sharing diagnostic testing equipment used in the initial diagnostic test with another Medicare-enrolled individual or organization.</P>
        <P>(16) Enrolls for any diagnostic testing services that it furnishes to a Medicare beneficiary, regardless of whether the service is furnished in a mobile or fixed base location.</P>
        <P>(17) Bills for all mobile diagnostic services that are furnished to a Medicare beneficiary, unless the mobile diagnostic service is part of a service provided under arrangement as described in section 1861(w)(1) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Failure to meet standards.</E> If an IDTF fails to meet one or more of the standards in paragraph (g) of this section at the time of enrollment, its enrollment will be denied. CMS will revoke a supplier's billing privileges if and IDTF is found not to meet the standards in paragraph (g) or (b)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Effective date of billing privileges.</E> The filing date of the Medicare enrollment application is the date that the Medicare contractor receives a signed provider enrollment application that it is able to process to approval. The effective date of billing privileges for a newly enrolled IDTF is the later of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The filing date of the Medicare enrollment application that was subsequently approved by a Medicare fee-for-service contractor; or</P>
        <P>(2) The date the IDTF first started furnishing services at its new practice location.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Coverage of ambulance services.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rules.</E> Medicare Part B covers ambulance services if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(1) The supplier meets the applicable vehicle, staff, and billing and reporting requirements of § 410.41 and the service meets the medical necessity and origin and destination requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) Medicare Part A payment is not made directly or indirectly for the services.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Levels of service.</E> Medicare covers the following levels of ambulance service, which are defined in § 414.605 of this chapter:</P>
        <P>(1) Basic life support (BLS) (emergency and nonemergency).</P>
        <P>(2) Advanced life support, level 1 (ALS1) (emergency and nonemergency).</P>
        <P>(3) Advanced life support, level 2 (ALS2).</P>
        <P>(4) Paramedic ALS intercept (PI).</P>
        <P>(5) Specialty care transport (SCT).</P>
        <P>(6) Fixed wing transport (FW).</P>
        <P>(7) Rotary wing transport (RW).</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Paramedic ALS intercept services.</E> Paramedic ALS intercept services must meet the following requirements:</P>
        <P>(1) Be furnished in an area that is designated as a rural area by any law or regulation of the State or that is located in a rural census tract of a metropolitan statistical area (as determined under the most recent Goldsmith Modification). (The Goldsmith Modification is a methodology to identify small towns and rural areas within large metropolitan counties that are isolated from central areas by distance or other features.)</P>
        <P>(2) Be furnished under contract with one or more volunteer ambulance services that meet the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(i) Are certified to furnish ambulance services as required under § 410.41.</P>
        <P>(ii) Furnish services only at the BLS level.</P>
        <P>(iii) Be prohibited by State law from billing for any service.</P>
        <P>(3) Be furnished by a paramedic ALS intercept supplier that meets the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(i) Is certified to furnish ALS services as required in § 410.41(b)(2).</P>
        <P>(ii) Bills all the beneficiaries who receive ALS intercept services from the entity, regardless of whether or not those beneficiaries are Medicare beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Medical necessity requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Medicare covers ambulance services, including fixed wing and rotary wing ambulance services, only if they are furnished to a beneficiary whose medical condition is such that other means of transportation are contraindicated. The beneficiary's condition must require both the ambulance transportation itself and the level of service provided in order for the billed service to be considered medically necessary. Nonemergency transportation by ambulance is appropriate if either: the beneficiary is bed-confined, and it is documented that the beneficiary's condition is such that other methods of transportation are contraindicated; or, if his or her medical condition, regardless of bed confinement, is such that transportation by ambulance is medically required. Thus, bed confinement is not the sole criterion in determining the medical necessity of ambulance transportation. It is one factor that is <PRTPAGE P="418"/>considered in medical necessity determinations. For a beneficiary to be considered bed-confined, the following criteria must be met:</P>
        <P>(i) The beneficiary is unable to get up from bed without assistance.</P>
        <P>(ii) The beneficiary is unable to ambulate.</P>
        <P>(iii) The beneficiary is unable to sit in a chair or wheelchair.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule for nonemergency, scheduled, repetitive ambulance services.</E> (i) Medicare covers medically necessary nonemergency, scheduled, repetitive ambulance services if the ambulance provider or supplier, before furnishing the service to the beneficiary, obtains a written order from the beneficiary's attending physician certifying that the medical necessity requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met. The physician's order must be dated no earlier than 60 days before the date the service is furnished.</P>
        <P>(ii) In all cases, the provider or supplier must keep appropriate documentation on file and, upon request, present it to the contractor. The presence of the signed physician certification statement does not alone demonstrate that the ambulance transport was medically necessary. All other program criteria must be met in order for payment to be made.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Special rule for nonemergency ambulance services that are either unscheduled or that are scheduled on a nonrepetitive basis.</E> Medicare covers medically necessary nonemergency ambulance services that are either unscheduled or that are scheduled on a nonrepetitive basis under one of the following circumstances:</P>
        <P>(i) For a resident of a facility who is under the care of a physician if the ambulance provider or supplier obtains a written order from the beneficiary's attending physician, within 48 hours after the transport, certifying that the medical necessity requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met.</P>
        <P>(ii) For a beneficiary residing at home or in a facility who is not under the direct care of a physician. A physician certification is not required.</P>
        <P>(iii) If the ambulance provider or supplier is unable to obtain a signed physician certification statement from the beneficiary's attending physician, a signed certification statement must be obtained from either the physician assistant (PA), nurse practitioner (NP), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), registered nurse (RN), or discharge planner, who has personal knowledge of the beneficiary's condition at the time the ambulance transport is ordered or the service is furnished. This individual must be employed by the beneficiary's attending physician or by the hospital or facility where the beneficiary is being treated and from which the beneficiary is transported. Medicare regulations for PAs, NPs, and CNSs apply and all applicable State licensure laws apply; or,</P>
        <P>(iv) If the ambulance provider or supplier is unable to obtain the required certification within 21 calendar days following the date of the service, the ambulance supplier must document its attempts to obtain the requested certification and may then submit the claim. Acceptable documentation includes a signed return receipt from the U.S. Postal Service or other similar service that evidences that the ambulance supplier attempted to obtain the required signature from the beneficiary's attending physician or other individual named in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(v) In all cases, the provider or supplier must keep appropriate documentation on file and, upon request, present it to the contractor. The presence of the signed certification statement or signed return receipt does not alone demonstrate that the ambulance transport was medically necessary. All other program criteria must be met in order for payment to be made.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Origin and destination requirements.</E> Medicare covers the following ambulance transportation:</P>
        <P>(1) From any point of origin to the nearest hospital, CAH, or SNF that is capable of furnishing the required level and type of care for the beneficiary's illness or injury. The hospital or CAH must have available the type of physician or physician specialist needed to treat the beneficiary's condition.</P>
        <P>(2) From a hospital, CAH, or SNF to the beneficiary's home.</P>

        <P>(3) From a SNF to the nearest supplier of medically necessary services not available at the SNF where the <PRTPAGE P="419"/>beneficiary is a resident, including the return trip.</P>
        <P>(4) For a beneficiary who is receiving renal dialysis for treatment of ESRD, from the beneficiary's home to the nearest facility that furnishes renal dialysis, including the return trip.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Specific limits on coverage of ambulance services outside the United States.</E> If services are furnished outside the United States, Medicare Part B covers ambulance transportation to a foreign hospital only in conjunction with the beneficiary's admission for medically necessary inpatient services as specified in subpart H of part 424 of this chapter.</P>

        <P>(c) <E T="03">Application of the Part B annual deductible.</E> (1) Before payment is made under § 410.152, an individual's incurred expenses for the calendar year are reduced by the Part B annual deductible.</P>
        <P>(2) The Part B annual deductible is applied to incurred expenses in the order in which claims for those expenses are processed by the Medicare program.</P>
        <P>(3) Only one Part B annual deductible may be imposed for any calendar year and it may be met by any combination of expenses incurred in that year.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rule for services reimbursable on a formula basis.</E> (1) In applying the formula that takes into account reasonable costs, customary charges, and customary (insofar as reasonable) charges, and is used to determine payment for services furnished by a provider that is not a nominal charge provider, the Medicare intermediary takes the following steps:</P>
        <P>(i) Reduces the customary charges for the services by an amount equal to any unmet portion of the deductible for the calendar year, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. (The amount of this reduction is considered to be the amount of the deductible that is met on the basis of the services to which it is applied.)</P>
        <P>(ii) Determines 20 percent of any remaining portion of the customary (insofar as reasonable) charge.</P>
        <P>(iii) Determines the lesser of the reasonable cost of the services and the customary charges for the services.</P>
        <P>(iv) Reduces the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section by the sum of the reduction made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and the amount determined under parargaph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(v) Reduces the reasonable cost of the services by the amount of the reduction made under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and multiplies the result by 80 percent.</P>
        <P>(2) In accordance with § 410.152(b)(1), the amount payable is the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, or the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, whichever is less.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Special rule for services of an independent rural health clinic.</E> Application of the Part B annual deductible to rural health clinic services is in accordance with § 405.2425(b)(2) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Amount of the Part B annual deductible.</E> (1) Beginning with expenses for services furnished during calendar year 2006, and for all succeeding years, the annual deductible is the previous year's deductible plus the annual percentage increase in the monthly actuarial rate for Medicare enrollees age 65 and over, rounded to the nearest dollar.</P>
        <P>(2) For 2005, the deductible is $110.</P>
        <P>(3) From 1991 through 2004, the deductible was $100.</P>
        <P>(4) From 1982 through 1990, the deductible was $75.</P>
        <P>(5) From 1973 through 1981, the deductible was $60.</P>
        <P>(6) From 1966 through 1972, the deductible was $50.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Carryover of Part B annual deductible.</E> For calendar years before 1982, the Part B annual deductible was reduced <PRTPAGE P="464"/>by the amount of expenses incurred during the last quarter of the preceding year that was applied to meet the deductible for that preceding year. <E T="03">Example:</E> If $20 of expenses incurred in November 1980 was used to meet the 1980 deductible, the 1981 deductible was reduced to $40 ($60-$20).</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Examples of application of the annual deductible.</E> (1) Mr. A submitted claims for the following expenses incurred during 1982: $20 for services furnished in March by physician X; $30 for services furnished in April by physician Y; $50 for services furnished in June by physician Z, for a total of $100. The carrier determined that the charges as submitted were the reasonable charges. The first $75 of expenses for which claims were processed is applied to meet the $75 deductible for that year. Medicare Part B pays 80 percent of the remaining $25, or $20.</P>
        <P>(2) Mr. B submitted a claim that included a $25 charge by a doctor for an examination to prescribe a hearing aid and an $80 charge for office surgery. This was the first claim relating to Mr. B's medical expenses processed in the calendar year. The carrier disallowed the $25 charge because the type of examination is not covered by Medicare. The carrier reduced the $80 surgery charge to a reasonable charge of $40. Only the $40 reasonable charge for covered services will count toward meeting Mr. B's deductible. Since the remainder of the surgery charge constitutes and excess over the reasonable charge, it cannot be applied to satisfy Mr. B's deductible.</P>
        <P>(3) Mr. C became entitled to Medicare Part B benefits on July 1, 1982. He incurred expenses of $200 in July, August, and September. The carrier determined that the changes as submitted were reasonable. Even though Mr. C was entitled to benefits for only half the year, he must meet the full $75 deductible. Thus, $75 of this expense constitutes Mr. C's deductible. Medicare would pay $100, which is 80 percent of the remaining $125.</P>
