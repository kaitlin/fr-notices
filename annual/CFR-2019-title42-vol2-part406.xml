        <SUBJECT>Application or enrollment for hospital insurance.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic provision.</E> In most cases, eligibility for Medicare Part A is a result of entitlement to monthly social security or railroad retirement cash benefits or eligibility for monthly social security cash benefits. This section specifies the individuals who need not file an application to become entitled to hospital insurance, those who must file an application, and those who must enroll.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Individuals who need not file an application for hospital insurance.</E> An individual who meets any of the following conditions need not file an application for hospital insurance:</P>
        <P>(1) Is under age 65 and has been entitled, for more than 24 months, to monthly social security or railroad retirement benefits based on disability.</P>
        <P>(2) At the time of attainment of age 65, is entitled to monthly social security or railroad retirement benefits.</P>
        <P>(3) Establishes entitlement to monthly social security or railroad retirement benefits at any time after attaining age 65.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Individuals who must file an application for hospital insurance.</E> An individual must file an application for hospital insurance if he or she seeks entitlement to hospital insurance on the basis of—</P>
        <P>(1) The transitional provisions set forth in § 406.11;</P>
        <P>(2) Deemed entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's benefit under certain circumstances as provided in § 406.12;</P>
        <P>(3) A diagnosis of end-stage renal disease, as specified in § 406.13;</P>
        <P>(4) Effective January 1, 1981, eligibility for social security cash benefits, as specified in § 406.10(a)(3), if the individual has attained age 65 without applying for those benefits; or</P>
        <P>(5) The special provisions applicable to government employment as set forth in § 406.15.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">When application is deemed to be filed.</E> (1) An application based on the transitional provisions or on ESRD is deemed to be filed in the first month of eligibility if it is filed not more than 3 months before the first month, and is retroactive to that month if filed within 12 months after the first month. An application filed more than 12 months after the first month of eligibility is retroactive to the 12th month before the month it is filed.</P>
        <P>(2) An application for deemed entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's benefits, that is filed before the first month in which the individual meets all conditions of entitlement for this benefit, will be deemed a valid application if those conditions are met before an initial determination, reconsideration, or hearing decision is made on the application. If the conditions are met after the date of any hearing decision, a new application will have to be filed. An application validly filed within 12 months after the first month of eligibility is retroactive to that first month. If filed more than 12 months after that first month, it is retroactive to the 12th month before the month of filing.</P>

        <P>(3) Effective June 8, 1980, an application based on eligibility for social security benefits at or after age 65, that is filed before the first month in which the individual meets all eligibility conditions for this benefit, will be deemed a valid application if those conditions <PRTPAGE P="314"/>are met before an initial determination, reconsideration, or hearing decision is made on the application. If the conditions are met after the date of any hearing decision, a new application will have to be filed.</P>
        <P>(4) Effective March 1, 1981, an application under § 406.10 that is validly filed within 6 months after the first month of eligibility is retroactive to that first month. If filed more than 6 months after that first month, it is retroactive to the 6th month before the month of filing.</P>

        <P>(2) Has been convicted of conspiracy to establish a dictatorship under section 4 of the Internal Security Act of 1950;</P>
        <P>(3) On February 16, 1965, was or could have been covered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959; or</P>

        <SUBJECT>Individual under age 65 who is entitled to social security or railroad retirement disability benefits.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic requirements.</E> An individual under age 65 is entitled to hospital insurance benefits if, for 25 months, he or she has been—</P>
        <P>(1) Entitled or deemed entitled to social security disability benefits as an insured individual, child, widow, or widower who is “under a disability” or</P>
        <P>(2) A disabled qualified beneficiary certified under Section 7(d) of the Railroad Retirement Act.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Previous periods of disability benefits entitlement.</E> Months of a previous period of entitlement or deemed entitlement to disability benefits count toward the 25-month requirement if any of the following conditions is met:</P>
        <P>(1) Entitlement was as an insured individual or a disabled qualified railroad retirement beneficiary, and the previous period ended within the 60 months preceding the month in which the current disability began.</P>

        <P>(2) Entitlement was as a disabled child, widow, or widower, and the previous period ended within the 84 months preceding the month in which the current disability began.<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) The previous period ended on or after March 1, 1988 and the current impairment is the same as, or directly related to, the impairment on which the previous period of entitlement was based.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Deemed entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's monthly benefits</E>—(1) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (c) (2), (3), and (4) of this section are intended to enable individuals—</P>
        <P>(i) To meet the 25-month requirement of paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
        <P>(ii) To retain hospital insurance entitlement when they are no longer entitled to monthly disability benefits.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Deemed entitlement for certain individuals entitled to old-age insurance benefits.</E> An individual who becomes entitled to monthly old-age insurance benefits before age 65, is, by law, precluded from establishing or retaining entitlement to disabled widow's or widower's monthly benefits. However, for purposes of meeting the 25-month requirement, a widow or widower who meets all other requirements for disability benefits and is excluded solely because of entitlement to old-age insurance benefits, shall be deemed to be (or to continue to be) entitled to disability benefits. A widow or widower who is not entitled to disability benefits for the month before attaining age 60 must file two applications, one for old-age insurance benefits and one for hospital insurance.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Deemed entitlement for certain individuals entitled to mother's benefits.</E> An individual entitled to mother's insurance benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act cannot at the same time be entitled to disabled widow's benefits. However, if she applies for hospital insurance, she will be deemed to be entitled to disabled widow's monthly benefits in the first month (of the 12 months before application) in which she would have been entitled to those benefits if she had filed an application for them.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Deemed entitlement for certain individuals entitled to father's benefits.</E> An individual who is entitled to father's insurance benefits under section 202(g) of the Act cannot at the same time be entitled to disabled widower's benefits. However, if he applies for hospital insurance benefits, he will be deemed to be entitled to disabled widower's monthly benefits as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) If he applied for hospital insurance benefits before May 1984, he was deemed entitled to disabled widower's benefits for any month after April 1981 for which he would have been entitled to those benefits if he had filed an application for them.</P>
        <P>(ii) If he applies for hospital insurance benefits in or after May 1984, he is deemed entitled to disabled widower's benefits for any month, up to 12 months before the month of application, for which he would have been entitled to those benefits if he had filed an application for them.</P>
        <P>(iii) Hospital insurance entitlement under this paragraph (c)(4) could not begin before May 1983.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Deemed retroactive entitlement for certain disabled widows and widowers.</E> In some cases, disabled widows or widowers cannot become entitled to monthly cash benefits before the month in which they file application. However, for purposes of meeting the 25-month requirement, disability benefit entitlement will be deemed to have begun with the earliest month (of the 12 months before the application for cash benefits) in which the individual met all the requirements except the filing of an application.

        <P> (1) Entitlement to hospital insurance begins with the 25th month of an individual's entitlement or deemed entitlement to disability benefits. Although an individual is not entitled to disability benefits for the month in which he or she dies, for purposes of this paragraph the individual will be deemed to be entitled for the month of death.</P>
        <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, entitlement to hospital insurance ends with the earliest of the following:</P>

        <P>(i) The last day of the last month in which he or she was entitled or deemed entitled to disability benefits or was qualified as a disabled railroad retirement beneficiary, if he or she was notified of the termination of entitlement before that month.<PRTPAGE P="317"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) The last day of the month following the month in which he or she is mailed a notice that his or her entitlement or deemed entitlement to disability benefits, or his or her status as a qualified disabled railroad retirement beneficiary, has ended.</P>
        <P>(iii) The last day of the month before the month he or she attains age 65. (An individual who is entitled to social security or railroad retirement cash benefits for the month of attainment of age 65 is automatically entitled to hospital insurance under § 406.10.)</P>
        <P>(iv) The day of death.</P>

          <E T="03">Reentitlement period</E> means a period as defined in 20 CFR 404.1592a that begins with the first month after the trial work period and ends with the 36th month after the trial work period or, if earlier, with the first month in which the impairment no longer exists or is no longer disabling. (During the reentitlement period, benefits may be discontinued because of SGA. However, if SGA is later discontinued, benefits may be reinstated without a new application and a new disability determination.)</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Duration of continued Medicare entitlement.</E> If an individual's entitlement to disability benefits or status as a qualified disabled railroad retirement beneficiary ends because he or she engaged in, or demonstrated the ability to engage in, substantial gainful activity after the 36 months following the end of the trial work period, Medicare entitlement continues until the earlier of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The last day of the 78th month following the first month of substantial gainful activity occurring after the 15th month of the individual's reentitlement period or, if later, the end of the month following the month the individual's disability benefit entitlement ends.</P>
        <P>(ii) The last day of the month following the month in which notice is mailed to the individual indicating that he or she is no longer entitled to hospital insurance because of an event or circumstance (for example, there has been medical improvement, or the disabled widow has remarried) that would terminate disability benefit entitlement if it had not already been terminated because of substantial gainful activity.</P>

        <P>(1) An individual who initiates a regular course of renal dialysis or has a kidney transplant during the 12-month period after the previous course of dialysis ended is entitled to Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B with the month the regular course of dialysis is resumed or the month the kidney is transplanted.</P>
        <P>(2) An individual who initiates a regular course of renal dialysis or has a kidney transplant during the 36-month period after an earlier kidney transplant is entitled to Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B with the month the regular course of dialysis begins or with the month the subsequent kidney transplant occurs.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special provisions applicable to Medicare qualified government employment.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> As used in this section, <E T="03">Medicare-qualified government employment</E> means Federal, State, or local government employment that is subject only to the hospital insurance portion of the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (F.I.C.A.). This includes—</P>
        <P>(1) Wages paid for Federal employment after December 1982.</P>
        <P>(2) Wages paid to State and local government employees hired after March 31, 1986.</P>
        <P>(3) Wages paid to State and local government employees hired before April 1, 1986 but whose employment after March 31, 1986 is covered, for Medicare purposes only, under an agreement under section 218 of the Act.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Crediting of wages that are taxable only for Medicare purposes.</E> Medicare qualified government employment is credited in the same way and in the same amount as social security covered employment is credited for monthly social security cash benefit purposes. However, since only the Medicare portion (not the social security portion) of the F.I.C.A. tax is imposed, Medicare qualified government employment does not help qualify the individual for monthly Social Security cash benefits.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Required quarters of coverage.</E> (1) To qualify for hospital insurance on the basis of Medicare qualified government employment, an individual must have the number of quarters of coverage necessary to qualify for hospital insurance under § 406.10, § 406.12, or § 406.13.</P>
        <P>(2) An individual who has worked in Medicare qualified government employment may qualify for hospital insurance on the basis of Medicare qualified government employment exclusively, or a combination of Medicare qualified government employment and social security covered employment.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Transitional provision for Federal employment.</E> Any individual who was a Federal employee at any time both during and before January 1983 will receive credit for quarters of Federal employment before January 1983 without paying tax. This transitional provision applies even if the Federal employee did not receive Federal wages for January 1983, for instance, because he or she was on approved leave without pay or on loan to a State or foreign agency.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Conditions of entitlement.</E> An individual who has worked in Medicare qualified government employment (or any related individual who would be <PRTPAGE P="320"/>entitled to social security cash benefits on the employee's record if Medicare qualified government employment qualified for those benefits) is entitled to hospital insurance benefits if he or she—</P>
        <P>(1) Would meet the requirements of § 406.10, § 406.12, or § 406.13 if Medicare qualified government employment were social security covered employment; and</P>
        <P>(2) Has filed an application for hospital insurance.</P>
        <FP>For purposes of this section not more than 12 months before the month of application may be counted towards the 25-month qualifying period specified in § 406.12(a).</FP>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Beginning and end of entitlement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> Subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, entitlement begins and ends as specified in § 406.10, § 406.12 or § 406.13, whichever is used to establish hospital insurance entitlement for the Federal, State, or local government employee or related individual.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitations: Federal government employment.</E> (i) Hospital insurance entitlement based on Federal employment could not begin before January 1983.</P>
        <P>(ii) No months before January 1983 may be used to satisfy the qualifying period required for entitlement based on disability.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Limitations: State and local government employment.</E> (i) Hospital insurance entitlement based on State or local government employment cannot begin before April 1986.</P>

        <P>(b) <E T="03">Monthly premiums: Determination of dollar amount.</E> (1) Effective for calendar years beginning January 1989, the dollar amount is determined based on an estimate of one-twelfth of the average per capita costs for benefits and administrative costs that will be payable with respect to individuals age 65 or over from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund during the succeeding calendar year.</P>
        <P>(2) Before 1989, the dollar amount was determined by multiplying $33 by the ratio of the next year's inpatient deductible to $76, which was the inpatient deductible determined for 1973. (Because of cost controls, the deductible actually charged for that year was $72.)</P>
        <P>(3) Effective for months beginning January 1994, if an individual meets the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, the monthly premium determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is reduced in each month in which the individual meets the requirements by 25 percent in 1994, 30 percent in 1995, 35 percent in 1996, 40 percent in 1997 and 45 percent in 1998 and thereafter.</P>

        <P>(2) Mary T's initial enrollment period ended in April 1980 but she did not enroll until May 1981. The months to be counted are May 1980 through May 1981. Since 13 months has elapsed, the premium would be increased by 10 percent.</P>
        <P>(3) Effective with July 1986, Mary T, in Example 2, would no longer have to pay an increased premium because she had paid it for twice the number of full 12-month periods during which she could have been, but was not, enrolled in the program.</P>
        <P>(4) Vincent C's initial enrollment period ended August 31, 1986. He was covered under his wife's employer group health plan until she retired on May 31, 1989. He enrolled during June 1989, the first month of the special enrollment period under § 406.21(e). No months are countable for premium increase purposes because the exclusions of paragraph (a) of this section apply to all months.</P>
        <P>(5) Terry P enrolled in the 1987 general enrollment period, with coverage effective July 1987. There were 28 months after the end of his initial enrollment period through the end of the 1987 general enrollment period. His premium is increased by 10 percent.
