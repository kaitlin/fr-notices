      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 411.1</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Basis and scope.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory basis.</E> Sections 1814(a) and 1835(a) of the Act require that a <PRTPAGE P="468"/>physician certify or recertify a patient's need for home health services but, in general, prohibit a physician from certifying or recertifying the need for services if the services will be furnished by an HHA in which the physician has a significant ownership interest, or with which the physician has a significant financial or contractual relationship. Sections 1814(c), 1835(d), and 1862 of the Act exclude from Medicare payment certain specified services. The Act provides special rules for payment of services furnished by the following: Federal providers or agencies (sections 1814(c) and 1835(d)); hospitals and physicians outside of the U.S. (sections 1814(f) and 1862(a)(4)); and hospitals and SNFs of the Indian Health Service (section 1880 of the Act). Section 1877 of the Act sets forth limitations on referrals and payment for designated health services furnished by entities with which the referring physician (or an immediate family member of the referring physician) has a financial relationship.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subpart identifies:</P>
        <P>(1) The particular types of services that are excluded;</P>
        <P>(2) The circumstances under which Medicare denies payment for certain services that are usually covered; and</P>
        <P>(3) The circumstances under which Medicare pays for services usually excluded from payment.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 411.2</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Conclusive effect of QIO determinations on payment of claims.</SUBJECT>
        <P>If a utilization and quality control quality improvement organization (QIO) has assumed review responsibility, in accordance with part 466 of this chapter, for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare payment is not made for those services unless the conditions of subpart C of part 466 of this chapter are met.</P>

      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 411.4</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Services for which neither the beneficiary nor any other person is legally obligated to pay.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as provided in § 411.8(b) (for services paid by a governmental entity), Medicare does not pay for a service if—</P>
        <P>(1) The beneficiary has no legal obligation to pay for the service; and</P>
        <P>(2) No other person or organization (such as a prepayment plan of which the beneficiary is a member) has a legal obligation to provide or pay for that service.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Special conditions for services furnished to individuals in custody of penal authorities.</E> Individuals who are in custody include, but are not limited to, individuals who are under arrest, incarcerated, imprisoned, escaped from confinement, under supervised release, on medical furlough, required to reside in mental health facilities, required to reside in halfway houses, required to live under home detention, or confined completely or partially in any way under a penal statute or rule. Payment may be made for services furnished to individuals or groups of individuals who are in the custody of police or other penal authorities or in the custody of a government agency under a penal statute only if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(1) State or local law requires those individuals or groups of individuals to repay the cost of medical services they receive while in custody.</P>
        <P>(2) The State or local government entity enforces the requirement to pay by billing all such individuals, whether or not covered by Medicare or any other health insurance, and by pursuing collection of the amounts they owe in the same way and with the same vigor that it pursues the collection of other debts.</P>

        <P>(a) If CMS takes action to recover conditional payments, the beneficiary must cooperate in the action.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Recovery of conditional payments.</SUBJECT>

        <P>If a Medicare conditional payment is made, the following rules apply:<PRTPAGE P="477"/>
        </P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Release of information.</E> The filing of a Medicare claim by on or behalf of the beneficiary constitutes an express authorization for any entity, including State Medicaid and workers' compensation agencies, and data depositories, that possesses information pertinent to the Medicare claim to release that information to CMS. This information will be used only for Medicare claims processing and for coordination of benefits purposes.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Right to initiate recovery.</E> CMS may initiate recovery as soon as it learns that payment has been made or could be made under workers' compensation, any liability or no-fault insurance, or an employer group health plan.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Amount of recovery.</E> (1) If it is not necessary for CMS to take legal action to recover, CMS recovers the lesser of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The amount of the Medicare primary payment.</P>
        <P>(ii) The full primary payment amount that the primary payer is obligated to pay under this part without regard to any payment, other than a full primary payment that the primary payer has paid or will make, or, in the case of a primary payment beneficiary, the amount of the primary payment.</P>
        <P>(2) If it is necessary for CMS to take legal action to recover from the primary payer, CMS may recover twice the amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Methods of recovery.</E> CMS may recover by direct collection or by offset against any monies CMS owes the entity responsible for refunding the conditional payment.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Recovery from primary payers.</E> CMS has a direct right of action to recover from any primary payer.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Claims filing requirements.</E> (1) CMS may recover without regard to any claims filing requirements that the insurance program or plan imposes on the beneficiary or other claimant such as a time limit for filing a claim or a time limit for notifying the plan or program about the need for or receipt of services.</P>
        <P>(2) However, CMS will not recover its payment for particular services in the face of a claims filing requirement unless it has filed a claim for recovery by the end of the year following the year in which the Medicare intermediary or carrier that paid the claim has notice that the third party is a primary plan to Medicare for those particular services. (A notice received during the last three months of a year is considered received during the following year.)</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Recovery from parties that receive primary payments.</E> CMS has a right of action to recover its payments from any entity, including a beneficiary, provider, supplier, physician, attorney, State agency or private insurer that has received a primary payment.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Reimbursement to Medicare.</E> If the beneficiary or other party receives a primary payment, the beneficiary or other party must reimburse Medicare within 60 days.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Special rules.</E> (1) In the case of liability insurance settlements and disputed claims under employer group health plans, workers' compensation insurance or plan, and no-fault insurance, the following rule applies: If Medicare is not reimbursed as required by paragraph (h) of this section, the primary payer must reimburse Medicare even though it has already reimbursed the beneficiary or other party.</P>
        <P>(2) The provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this section also apply if a primary payer makes its payment to an entity other than Medicare when it is, or should be, aware that Medicare has made a conditional primary payment.</P>
        <P>(3) In situations that involve procurement costs, the rule of § 411.37(b) applies.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Recovery against Medicaid agency.</E> If a primary payment is made to a State Medicaid agency and that agency does not reimburse Medicare, CMS may reduce any Federal funds due the Medicaid agency (under title XIX of the Act) by an amount equal to the Medicare payment or the primary payment, whichever is less.</P>
        <P>(k) <E T="03">Recovery against Medicare contractor.</E> If a Medicare contractor, including an intermediary or carrier, also insures, underwrites, or administers as a third party administrator, a program or plan that is primary to Medicare, and does not reimburse Medicare, CMS may offset the amount owed against any funds due the intermediary or carrier under title XVIII of <PRTPAGE P="478"/>the Act or due the contractor under the contract.</P>
        <P>(l) <E T="03">Recovery when there is failure to file a proper claim</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> If Medicare makes a conditional payment with respect to services for which the beneficiary or provider or supplier has not filed a proper claim with a primary payer, and Medicare is unable to recover from the primary payer, Medicare may recover from the beneficiary or provider or supplier that was responsible for the failure to file a proper claim.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (i) This rule does not apply in the case of liability insurance nor when failure to file a proper claim is due to mental or physical incapacity of the beneficiary.</P>
        <P>(ii) CMS will not recover from providers or suppliers that are in compliance with the requirements of § 489.20 of this chapter and can show that the reason they failed to file a proper claim is that the beneficiary, or someone acting on his or her behalf, failed to give, or gave erroneous, information regarding coverage that is primary to Medicare.</P>
        <P>(m) <E T="03">Interest charges.</E> (1) With respect to recovery of payments for items and services furnished before October 31, 1994, CMS charges interest, exercising common law authority in accordance with 45 CFR 30.13, consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711).</P>
        <P>(2) In addition to its common law authority with respect to recovery of payments for items and services furnished on or after October 31, 1994, CMS charges interest in accordance with section 1862(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. Under that provision—</P>
        <P>(i) CMS may charge interest if reimbursement is not made to the appropriate trust fund before the expiration of the 60-day period that begins on the date on which notice or other information is received by CMS that payment has been or could be made under a primary plan;</P>
        <P>(ii) Interest may accrue from the date when that notice or other information is received by CMS, is charged until reimbursement is made, and is applied for full 30-day periods; and</P>
        <P>(iii) The rate of interest is that provided at § 405.378(d) of this chapter.</P>

        <P>(a) The fact that Medicare payments are limited to the DRG amount, or the reasonable charge, reasonable cost, capitation or fee schedule rate, does not affect the amount that a primary payer may pay.</P>
        <P>(b) With respect to workers' compensation plans, no-fault insurers, and employer group health plans, a provider or supplier may bill its full charges and expect those charges to be paid unless there are limits imposed by laws other than title XVIII of the Act or by agreements with the primary payer.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Basis for Medicare secondary payments.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rules.</E> (1) Medicare benefits are secondary to benefits payable by a primary payer even if State law or the primary payer states that its benefits are secondary to Medicare benefits or otherwise limits its payments to Medicare beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, Medicare makes secondary payments, within the limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section and in § 411.33, to supplement the primary payment if that payment is less than the charges for the services and, in the case of services paid on other than a reasonable charge basis, less than the gross amount payable by Medicare under § 411.33(e).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Medicare does not make a secondary payment if the provider or supplier is either obligated to accept, or voluntarily accepts, as full payment, a primary payment that is less than its charges.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">General limitation: Failure to file a proper claim.</E> When a provider or supplier, or a beneficiary who is not physically or mentally incapacitated, receives a reduced primary payment because of failure to file a proper claim, the Medicare secondary payment may not exceed the amount that would have been payable under § 411.33 if the primary payer had paid on the basis of a proper claim.</P>
        <FP>The provider, supplier, or beneficiary must inform CMS that a reduced payment was made, and the amount that would have been paid if a proper claim had been filed.</FP>

        <SUBJECT>Amount of Medicare secondary payment.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Services for which CMS pays on a Medicare fee schedule or reasonable charge basis.</E> The Medicare secondary payment is the lowest of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The actual charge by the supplier (or the amount the supplier is obligated to accept as payment in full if that is less than the charges) minus the amount paid by the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(2) The amount that Medicare would pay if the services were not covered by a primary payer.</P>
        <P>(3) The higher of the Medicare fee schedule, Medicare reasonable charge, or other amount which would be payable under Medicare (without regard to any applicable Medicare deductible or coinsurance amounts) or the primary payer's allowable charge (without regard to any deductible or co-insurance imposed by the policy or plan) minus the amount actually paid by the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Example:</E> An individual received treatment from a physician for which the physician charged $175. The primary payer allowed $150 of the charge and paid 80 percent of this amount or $120. The Medicare fee schedule for this treatment is $125. The individual's Part <PRTPAGE P="480"/>B deductible had been met. As secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following amounts:</P>
        <P>(1) Excess of actual charge minus the primary payment: $175−120 = $55.</P>
        <P>(2) Amount Medicare would pay if the services were not covered by a primary payer: .80 × $125 = $100.</P>
        <P>(3) Primary payer's allowable charge without regard to its coinsurance (since that amount is higher than the Medicare fee schedule in this case) minus amount paid by the primary payer: $150−120 = $30.</P>
        <FP>The Medicare payment is $30.</FP>
        <P>(c)-(d) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Services reimbursed on a basis other than fee schedule, reasonable charge, or monthly capitation rate.</E> The Medicare secondary payment is the lowest of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The gross amount payable by Medicare (that is, the amount payable without considering the effect of the Medicare deductible and coinsurance or the payment by the primary payer), minus the applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts.</P>
        <P>(2) The gross amount payable by Medicare, minus the amount paid by the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(3) The provider's charges (or the amount the provider is obligated to accept as payment in full, if that is less than the charges), minus the amount payable by the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(4) The provider's charges (or the amount the provider is obligated to accept as payment in full if that is less than the charges), minus the applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Examples:</E> (1) A hospital furnished 7 days of inpatient hospital care in 1987 to a Medicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered services totaled $2,800. The primary payer paid $2,360. No part of the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible of $520 had been met. If the gross amount payable by Medicare in this case is $2,700, then as secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following amounts:</P>
        <P>(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible: $2,700−$520 = $2,180.</P>
        <P>(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the primary payment: $2,700−$2,360 = $340.</P>
        <P>(iii) The provider's charges minus the primary payment: $2,800−$2,360 = $440.</P>
        <P>(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $2,800−$520 = $2,280. Medicare's secondary payment is $340 and the combined payment made by the primary payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $2,700. The $520 deductible was satisfied by the primary payment so that the beneficiary incurred no out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
        <P>(2) A hospital furnished 1 day of inpatient hospital care in 1987 to a Medicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered services totalled $750. The primary payer paid $450. No part of the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible had been met previously. The primary payment is credited toward that deductible. If the gross amount payable by Medicare in this case is $850, then as secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following amounts:</P>
        <P>(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare deductible: $850−$520 = $330.</P>
        <P>(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the primary payment: $850−$450 = $400.</P>
        <P>(iii) The provider's charges minus the primary payment: $750−$450 = $300.</P>
        <P>(iv) The provider's charges minus the Medicare deductible: $750−$520 = $230. Medicare's secondary payment is $230, and the combined payment made by the primary payer and Medicare on behalf of the beneficiary is $680. The hospital may bill the beneficiary $70 (the $520 deductible minus the $450 primary payment). This fully discharges the beneficiary's deductible obligation.</P>
        <P>(3) An ESRD beneficiary received 8 dialysis treatments for which a facility charged $160 per treatment for a total of $1,280. No part of the beneficiary's $75 Part B deductible had been met. The primary payer paid $1,024 for Medicare-covered services. The composite rate per dialysis treatment at this facility is $131 or $1,048 for 8 treatments. As secondary payer, Medicare pays the lowest of the following:</P>

        <P>(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance: <PRTPAGE P="481"/>$1,048−$75−$194.60 = $778.40. (The coinsurance is calculated as follows: $1,048 composite rate−$75 deductible = $973 × .20 = $194.60).</P>
        <P>(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the primary payment: $1,048−$1,024 = $24.</P>
        <P>(iii) The provider's charges minus the primary payment: $1,280−$1,024 = $256.</P>
        <P>(iv) The provider's charge minus the Medicare deductible and coinsurance: $1,280−$75−$194.60 = 1010.40. Medicare pays $24. The beneficiary's Medicare deductible and coinsurance were met by the primary payment.</P>
        <P>(4) A hospital furnished 5 days of inpatient care in 1987 to a Medicare beneficiary. The provider's charges for Medicare-covered services were $4,000 and the gross amount payable was $3,500. The provider agreed to accept $3,000 from the primary payer as payment in full. The primary payer paid $2,900 due to a deductible requirement under the primary plan. Medicare considers the amount the provider is obligated to accept as full payment ($3,000) to be the provider charges. The Medicare secondary payment is the lowest of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the Medicare inpatient deductible: $3,500−$520 = $2,980.</P>
        <P>(ii) The gross amount payable by Medicare minus the primary payment: $3,500−$2,900 = $600.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> As used in this section <E T="03">Medicare-covered services</E> means services for which Medicare benefits are payable or would be payable except for the Medicare deductible and coinsurance provisions and the amounts payable by the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies when a workers' compensation plan, a no-fault insurer or an employer group health plan is primary to Medicare.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the amounts the provider or supplier may collect or seek to collect, for the Medicare-covered services from the beneficiary or any entity other than the workers' compensation plan, the no-fault insurer, or the employer plan and Medicare, are limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The amount paid or payable by the primary payer to the beneficiary. If this amount exceeds the amount payable by Medicare (without regard to deductible or coinsurance), the provider or supplier may retain the primary payment in full without violating the terms of the provider agreement or the conditions of assignment.</P>
        <P>(2) The amount, if any, by which the applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts exceed any primary payment made or due to the beneficiary or to the provider or supplier for the medical services.</P>
        <P>(3) The amount of any charges that may be made to a beneficiary under § 413.35 of this chapter when cost limits are applied to the services, or under § 489.32 of this chapter when the services are partially covered, but only to the extent that the primary payer is not responsible for those charges.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The limitations of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply if the services were furnished by a supplier that is not a participating supplier and has not accepted assignment for the services or claimed payment under § 424.64 of this chapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Amount of Medicare recovery when a primary payment is made as a result of a judgment or settlement.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Recovery against the party that received payment</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Medicare reduces its recovery to take account of the cost of procuring the judgment or settlement, as provided in this section, if—</P>
        <P>(i) Procurement costs are incurred because the claim is disputed; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Those costs are borne by the party against which CMS seeks to recover.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule.</E> If CMS must file suit because the party that received payment opposes CMS's recovery, the recovery amount is as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Recovery against the primary payer.</E> If CMS seeks recovery from the primary payer, in accordance with § 411.24(i), the recovery amount will be no greater than the amount determined under paragraph (c) or (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Medicare payments are less than the judgment or settlement amount.</E> If Medicare payments are less than the judgment or settlement amount, the recovery is computed as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) Determine the ratio of the procurement costs to the total judgment or settlement payment.</P>
        <P>(2) Apply the ratio to the Medicare payment. The product is the Medicare share of procurement costs.</P>

        <P>(i) The beneficiary creates an account to access his or her Medicare information through the CMS Web site.</P>
        <P>(ii) The appropriate Medicare contractor has received initial notice of a pending liability insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation settlement, judgment, award, or other payment and has posted the recovery case on the Web portal.</P>

        <P>(c) <E T="03">Obtaining a final conditional payment amount.</E> (1) A beneficiary, or his or her attorney or other representative, or an authorized applicable plan, may obtain a final conditional payment amount related to a pending liability <PRTPAGE P="483"/>insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation settlement, judgment, award, or other payment using the following process:</P>
        <P>(i) The beneficiary, his or her attorney or other representative, or an applicable plan, provides initial notice of a pending liability insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault insurance, and workers' compensation settlement, judgment, award, or other payment to the appropriate Medicare contractor before accessing information via the Web portal.</P>
        <P>(ii) The Medicare contractor compiles claims for which Medicare has paid conditionally that are related to the pending settlement, judgment, award, or other payment within 65 days or less of receiving the initial notice of the pending settlement, judgment, award, or other payment and posts a recovery case on the Web portal.</P>
        <P>(iii) If the underlying liability insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation claim derives from one of the following, the beneficiary, or his or her attorney or other representative, must provide notice to CMS' contractor via the Web portal in order to obtain a final conditional payment summary statement and amount through the Web portal:</P>
        <P>(A) Alleged exposure to a toxic substance.</P>
        <P>(B) Environmental hazard.</P>
        <P>(C) Ingestion of pharmaceutical drug or other product or substance.</P>
        <P>(D) Implantation of a medical device, joint replacement, or something similar.</P>
        <P>(iv) Up to 120 days before the anticipated date of a settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, the beneficiary, or his or her attorney, other representative, or authorized applicable plan may notify CMS, once and only once, via the Web portal, that a settlement, judgment, award or other payment is expected to occur within 120 days or less from the date of notification.</P>
        <P>(A) CMS may extend its response timeframe by an additional 30 days when it determines that additional time is required to address claims that Medicare has paid conditionally that are related to the settlement, judgment, award, or other payment in situations including, but not limited to, the following:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A recovery case that requires manual filtering to ensure that associated claims are related to the pending settlement, judgment, award, or other payment.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Internal CMS systems failures not otherwise considered caused by exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>(B) In exceptional circumstances, CMS may further extend its response timeframe by the number of days required to address the issue that resulted from such exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Systems failure(s) due to consequences of extreme adverse weather (loss of power, flooding, etc.).</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Security breaches of facilities or network(s).</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Terror threats; strikes and similar labor actions.</P>

        <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Similar circumstances beyond the ordinary control of government, private sector officers or management.</P>
        <P>(v) The beneficiary, or his or her attorney, or other representative may then address discrepancies by disputing individual conditional payments, once and only once, if he or she believes that the conditional payment included in the most up-to-date conditional payment summary statement is unrelated to the pending liability insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation settlement, judgment, award, or other payment.</P>
        <P>(A) The dispute process is not an appeals process, nor does it establish a right of appeal regarding that dispute. There will be no administrative or judicial review related to this dispute process.</P>

        <P>(B) The beneficiary, or his or her attorney or other representative may be required to submit supporting documentation in the form and manner <PRTPAGE P="484"/>specified by the Secretary to support his or her dispute.</P>
        <P>(vi) Disputes submitted through the Web portal and after the beneficiary, or his or her attorney, other representative, or authorized applicable plan has notified CMS that he or she is 120 days or less from the anticipated date of a settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, are resolved within 11 business days of receipt of the dispute and any required supporting documentation.</P>
        <P>(vii) When any disputes have been fully resolved, the beneficiary, or his or her attorney or other representative, may download or otherwise request a time and date stamped conditional payment summary statement through the Web portal.</P>
        <P>(A) If the download or request is within 3 days of the date of settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, that conditional payment summary statement will constitute Medicare's final conditional payment amount.</P>
        <P>(B) If the beneficiary, or his or her attorney or other representative, is within 3 days of the date of settlement, judgment, award, or other payment and any claim disputes have not been fully resolved, he or she may not download or otherwise request a final conditional payment summary statement.</P>
        <P>(viii) Within 30 days or less of securing a settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, the beneficiary, or his or her attorney or other representative, must submit through the Web portal documentation specified by the Secretary, including, but not limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(A) The date of settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, including the total settlement amount, the attorney fee amount or percentage.</P>
        <P>(B) Additional costs borne by the beneficiary to obtain his or her settlement, judgment, award, or other payment.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If settlement information is not provided within 30 days or less of securing the settlement, the final conditional payment amount obtained through the Web portal is void.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(ix) Once settlement, judgment, award, or other payment information is received, CMS applies a pro rata reduction to the final conditional payment amount in accordance with § 411.37 and issues a final MSP recovery demand letter.</P>
        <P>(2) An applicable plan may only obtain a final conditional payment amount related to a pending liability insurance (including self-insurance), no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation settlement, judgment, award, or other payment in the form and manner described in § 411.38(b) if the applicable plan has properly registered to use the Web portal and has obtained from the beneficiary, and submitted to the appropriate CMS contractor, proper proof of representation. The applicable plan may obtain read only access if the applicable plan obtains from the beneficiary, and submits to the appropriate CMS contractor, proper consent to release.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Obligations with respect to future medical items and services.</E> Final conditional payment amounts obtained via the Web portal represent Medicare covered and otherwise reimbursable items and services that are related to the beneficiary's settlement, judgment, award, or other payment furnished before the time and date stamped on the final conditional payment summary form.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Lump-sum commutation of future benefits.</E> If a lump-sum compensation award stipulates that the amount paid is intended to compensate the individual for all future medical expenses required because of the work-related injury or disease, Medicare payments for such services are excluded until medical expenses related to the injury or disease equal the amount of the lump-sum payment.</P>

        <P>(2) If a settlement appears to represent an attempt to shift to Medicare the responsibility for payment of medical expenses for the treatment of a work-related condition, the settlement will not be recognized. For example, if the parties to a settlement attempt to maximize the amount of disability benefits paid under workers' compensation by releasing the workers' compensation carrier from liability for medical expenses for a particular condition even though the facts show that the condition is work-related, Medicare will not pay for treatment of that condition.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Determining amount of compromise settlement considered as a payment for medical expenses.</E> (1) If a compromise settlement allocates a portion of the payment for medical expenses and also gives reasonable recognition to the income replacement element, that apportionment may be accepted as a basis for determining Medicare payments.</P>
        <P>(2) If the settlement does not give reasonable recognition to both elements of a workers' compensation award or does not apportion the sum granted, the portion to be considered as payment for medical expenses is computed as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) Determine the ratio of the amount awarded (less the reasonable and necessary costs incurred in procuring the settlement) to the total amount that would have been payable under workers' compensation if the claim had not been compromised.</P>

        <P>(ii) Multiply that ratio by the total medical expenses incurred as a result of the injury or disease up to the date of the settlement. The product is the amount of the workers' compensation settlement to be considered as payment for medical expenses.

        <EXAMPLE>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
          <P>As the result of a work injury, an individual suffered loss of income and incurred medical expenses for which the total workers' compensation payment would have been $24,000 if the case had not been compromised. The medical expenses amounted to $18,000. The workers' compensation carrier made a settlement with the beneficiary under which it paid $8,000 in total. A separate award was made for legal fees. Since the workers' compensation compromise settlement was for one-third of the amount which would have been payable under workers' compensation had the case not been compromised ($8,000/$24,000=<FR>1/3</FR>), the workers' compensation compromise settlement is considered to have paid for one-third of the total medical expenses (<FR>1/3</FR> × $18,000 = $6,000).</P>
        </EXAMPLE>

        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining the amount of the Medicare overpayment.</E> When conditional Medicare payments have been made, and the beneficiary receives a compromise settlement payment, the Medicare overpayment is determined as set forth in this paragraph (b). The amount of the workers' compensation payment that is considered to be for medical expenses (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) is applied, at the workers' compensation rate of payment prevailing in the particular jurisdiction, in the following order:</P>
        <P>(1) First to any beneficiary payments for services payable under workers' compensation but not covered under Medicare.</P>
        <P>(2) Then to any beneficiary payments for services payable under workers' compensation and also covered under Medicare Part B. (These include deductible and coinsurance amounts and, in unassigned cases, the charge in excess of the reasonable charge.)</P>
        <P>(3) Last to any beneficiary payments for services payable under workers' compensation and also covered under Medicare Part A. (These include Part A deductible and coinsurance amounts and charges for services furnished after benefits are exhausted.)</P>
        <FP>The difference between the amount of the workers' compensation payment for medical expenses and any beneficiary payments constitutes the Medicare overpayment. The beneficiary is liable for that amount.</FP>

        <EXAMPLE>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
          <P>In the example in paragraph (a) of this section, it was determined that the workers' compensation settlement paid for $6,000 of the total medical expenses. The $18,000 in medical expenses included $1,500 in charges for services not covered under Medicare, $7,500 in charges for services covered under Medicare Part B, and $9,000 in hospital charges for services covered under Medicare Part A. All charges were at the workers' compensation payment rate, that is, in amounts the provider or supplier must accept as payment in full.</P>

          <P>The Medicare reasonable charge for physicians' services was $7,000 and Medicare paid $5,600 (80 percent of the reasonable charge). The Part B deductible had been met. The <PRTPAGE P="487"/>Medicare payment rate for the hospital services was $8,000. Medicare paid the hospital $7,480 ($8,000—the Part A deductible of $520).</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory basis.</E> (1) Section 1862(b) of the Act provides in part that Medicare is secondary payer, under specified conditions, for services covered under any of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Group health plans of employers that employ at least 20 employees and that cover Medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older who are covered under the plan by virtue of the individual's current employment status with an employer or the current employment status of a spouse of any age. (Section 1862(b)(1)(A))</P>
        <P>(ii) Group health plans (without regard to the number of individuals employed and irrespective of current employment status) that cover individuals who have ESRD. Except as provided in § 411.163, group health plans are always primary payers throughout the first 18 months of ESRD-based Medicare eligibility or entitlement. (Section 1862(b)(1)(C))</P>
        <P>(iii) Large group health plans (that is, plans of employers that employ at least 100 employees) and that cover Medicare beneficiaries who are under age 65, entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability, and covered under the plan by virtue of the individual's or a family member's current employment status with an employer. (Section 1862(b)(1)(B))</P>
        <P>(2) Sections 1862(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act provide that group health plans and large group health plans may not take into account that the individuals described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are entitled to Medicare on the basis of age or disability, or eligible for, or entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD.</P>
        <P>(3) Section 1862(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Act provides that group health plans of employers of 20 or more employees must provide to any employee or spouse age 65 or older the same benefits, under the same conditions, that it provides to employees and spouses under 65. The requirement applies regardless of whether the individual or spouse 65 or older is entitled to Medicare.</P>
        <P>(4) Section 1862(b)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act provides that group health plans may not differentiate in the benefits they provide between individuals who have ESRD and other individuals covered under the plan on the basis of the existence of ESRD, the need for renal dialysis, or in any other manner. Actions that constitute “differentiating” are listed in § 411.161(b).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subpart sets forth general rules pertinent to—</P>
        <P>(1) Medicare payment for services that are covered under a group health plan and are furnished to certain beneficiaries who are entitled on the basis of ESRD, age, or disability.</P>
        <P>(2) The prohibition against taking into account Medicare entitlement based on age or disability, or Medicare eligibility or entitlement based on ESRD.</P>

        <P>(3) The prohibition against differentiation in benefits between individuals <PRTPAGE P="490"/>who have ESRD and other individuals covered under the plan.</P>
        <P>(4) The requirement to provide to those 65 or over the same benefits under the same conditions as are provided to those under 65.</P>
        <P>(5) The appeals procedures for group health plans that CMS determines are nonconforming plans.</P>

        <P>(1) The individual is actively working as an employee, is the employer (including a self-employed person), or is associated with the employer in a business relationship; or</P>
        <P>(2) The individual is not actively working and—</P>

        <P>(ii) Retains employment rights in the industry and has not had his employment terminated by the employer, if the employer provides the coverage (or has not had his membership in the employee organization terminated, if the employee organization provides the coverage), is not receiving disability benefits from an employer for more than 6 months, is not receiving disability benefits from Social Security, and has GHP coverage that is not pursuant to COBRA continuation coverage (26 U.S.C. 4980B; 29 U.S.C. 1161-1168; 42 U.S.C. 300bb-1 et seq.). Whether or not the individual is receiving pay during the period of nonwork is not a factor.</P>

        <P>(3) Persons who have health coverage that extends beyond or between active employment periods; for example, based on an hours bank arrangement. (Active union members often have hours bank coverage.)</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Coverage by virtue of current employment status.</E> An individual has coverage by virtue of current employment status with an employer if—</P>
        <P>(1) the individual has GHP or LGHP coverage based on employment, including coverage based on a certain number of hours worked for that employer or a certain level of commissions earned from work for that employer at any time; and</P>
        <P>(2) the individual has current employment status with that employer, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rule: Self-employed person.</E> A self-employed individual is considered to have GHP or LGHP coverage by virtue of current employment status during a particular tax year only if, during the preceding tax year, the individual's net earnings, from work in that year related to the employer that offers the group health coverage, are at least equal to the amount specified in section 211(b)(2) of the Act, which defines “self-employment income” for social security purposes.</P>

        <P>(ii) The individual is receiving cash remuneration from the religious order.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Members of religious orders who have taken a vow of poverty.</E> A member of a religious order whose members are required to take a vow of poverty is not considered to be employed by the order if the services he or she performs as a member of the order are considered employment only because the order elects social security coverage under section 3121(r) of the IRC. This exemption applies retroactively to services performed as a member of the order, beginning with the effective dates of the MSP provisions for the aged and the disabled, respectively. The exemption does not apply to services performed for employers outside of the order.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Members of the clergy.</E> A member of the clergy is considered to have current employment status with a church or other religious organization if the individual is receiving cash remuneration from the church or other religious organization for services rendered.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Special rule: Delayed compensation subject to FICA taxes.</E> An individual who is not working is not considered an employee solely on the basis of receiving delayed compensation payments for previous periods of work even if those payments are subject to FICA taxes (or would be subject to FICA taxes if the employer were not exempt from paying those taxes). For example, an individual who is not working in 1993 and receives payments subject to FICA taxes for work performed in 1992 is not considered to be an employee in 1993 solely on the basis of receiving those payments.</P>

        <P>(3) Terminating coverage because the individual has become entitled to Medicare, except as permitted under COBRA continuation coverage provisions (26 U.S.C. 4980B(f)(2)(B)(iv); 29 U.S.C. 1162.(2)(D); and 42 U.S.C. 300bb-2.(2)(D)).</P>
        <P>(4) In the case of a LGHP, denying or terminating coverage because an individual is entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability without denying or terminating coverage for similarly situated individuals who are not entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability.</P>
        <P>(5) Imposing limitations on benefits for a Medicare entitled individual that do not apply to others enrolled in the plan, such as providing less comprehensive health care coverage, excluding benefits, reducing benefits, charging higher deductibles or coinsurance, providing for lower annual or lifetime benefit limits, or more restrictive pre-existing illness limitations.</P>
        <P>(6) Charging a Medicare entitled individual higher premiums.</P>
        <P>(7) Requiring a Medicare entitled individual to wait longer for coverage to begin.</P>
        <P>(8) Paying providers and suppliers less for services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary than for the same services furnished to an enrollee who is not entitled to Medicare.</P>
        <P>(9) Providing misleading or incomplete information that would have the effect of inducing a Medicare entitled individual to reject the employer plan, thereby making Medicare the primary payer. An example of this would be informing the beneficiary of the right to accept or reject the employer plan but failing to inform the individual that, if he or she rejects the plan, the plan will not be permitted to provide or pay for secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>(10) Including in its health insurance cards, claims forms, or brochures distributed to beneficiaries, providers, and suppliers, instructions to bill Medicare first for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries without stipulating that such action may be taken only when Medicare is the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(11) Refusing to enroll an individual for whom Medicare would be secondary payer, when enrollment is available to similarly situated individuals for whom Medicare would not be secondary payer.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Permissible actions.</E> (1) If a GHP or LGHP makes benefit distinctions among various categories of individuals (distinctions unrelated to the fact that the individual is disabled, based, for instance, on length of time employed, occupation, or marital status), the GHP or LGHP may make the same distinctions among the same categories of individuals entitled to Medicare whose plan coverage is based on current employment status. For example, if a GHP or LGHP does not offer coverage to employees who have worked less than one year and who are <E T="03">not</E> entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability or age, the GHP or LGHP is not required to offer coverage to employees who have worked less than one year and who <E T="03">are</E> entitled to Medicare on the basis of disability or age.</P>
        <P>(2) A GHP or LGHP may pay benefits secondary to Medicare for an aged or disabled beneficiary who has current employment status if the plan coverage is COBRA continuation coverage because of reduced hours of work. Medicare is primary payer for this beneficiary because, although he or she has current employment status, the GHP coverage is by virtue of the COBRA law rather than by virtue of the current employment status.</P>

        <P>(3) A GHP may terminate COBRA continuation coverage of an individual who becomes entitled to Medicare on <PRTPAGE P="494"/>the basis of ESRD, when permitted under the COBRA provisions.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Basis for determination of nonconformance.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) A “determination of nonconformance” is a CMS determination that a GHP or LGHP is a nonconforming plan as provided in this section.</P>
        <P>(b) CMS makes a determination of nonconformance for a GHP or LGHP that, at any time during a calendar year, fails to comply with any of the following statutory provisions:</P>
        <P>(1) The prohibition against taking into account that a beneficiary who is covered or seeks to be covered under the plan is entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, age, or disability, or eligible on the basis of ESRD.</P>
        <P>(2) The nondifferentiation clause for individuals with ESRD.</P>
        <P>(3) The equal benefits clause for the working aged.</P>
        <P>(4) The obligation to refund conditional Medicare primary payments.</P>
        <P>(c) CMS may make a determination of nonconformance for a GHP or LGHP that fails to respond to a request for information, or to provide correct information, either voluntarily or in response to a CMS request, on the plan's primary payment obligation with respect to a given beneficiary, if that failure contributes to either or both of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Medicare erroneously making a primary payment.</P>
        <P>(2) A delay or foreclosure of CMS's ability to recover an erroneous primary payment.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Documentation of conformance.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Acceptable documentation.</E> CMS may require a GHP or LGHP to demonstrate that it has complied with the Medicare secondary payer provisions and to submit supporting documentation by an official authorized to act on behalf of the entity, under penalty of perjury. The following are examples of documentation that may be acceptable:</P>
        <P>(1) A copy of the employer's plan or policy that specifies the services covered, conditions of coverage, benefit levels and limitations with respect to persons entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD, age, or disability as compared to the provisions applicable to other enrollees and potential enrollees.</P>
        <P>(2) An explanation of the plan's allegation that it does not owe CMS any amount CMS claims the plan owes as repayment for conditional or mistaken Medicare primary payments.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Lack of acceptable documentation.</E> If a GHP or LGHP fails to provide acceptable evidence or documentation that it has complied with the MSP prohibitions and requirements set forth in § 411.110, CMS may make a determination of nonconformance for both the year in which the services were furnished and the year in which the request for information was made.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Determination of nonconformance.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Starting dates for determination of nonconformance.</E> CMS's authority to determine nonconformance of GHPs begins on the following dates:</P>
        <P>(1) On January 1, 1987 for MSP provisions that affect the disabled.</P>
        <P>(2) On December 20, 1989 for MSP provisions that affect ESRD beneficiaries and the working aged.</P>
        <P>(3) On August 10, 1993 for failure to refund mistaken Medicare primary payments.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Special rule for failure to repay.</E> A GHP that fails to comply with § 411.110 (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) in a particular year is nonconforming for that year. If, in a subsequent year, that plan fails to repay the resulting mistaken primary payments (in accordance with § 411.110(a)(4)), the plan is also nonconforming for the subsequent year. For example, if a plan paid secondary for the working aged in 1991, that plan was nonconforming for 1991. If in 1994 CMS identifies mistaken primary payments attributable to the 1991 violation, and the plan refuses to repay, it is also nonconforming for 1994.</P>

        <P>(vi) The fact that if none of the parties requests a hearing within 65 days from the date of its notice, the determination is binding on all parties unless it is reopened in accordance with § 411.126.</P>
        <P>(2) The notice also states that the plan must, within 30 days from the date on its notice, submit to CMS the names and addresses of all employers and employee organizations that contributed to the plan during the calendar year for which CMS has determined nonconformance.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice to contributing employers and employee organizations.</E> CMS mails written notice of the determination, including all the information specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to all contributing employers and employee organizations already known to CMS or identified by the plan in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        <P>(2) If no party files a request within the 65-day period, the initial determination of nonconformance is binding upon all parties unless it is reopened in accordance with § 411.126.</P>
        <P>(3) If more than one party requests a hearing the hearing officer conducts a single hearing in which all parties may participate.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">On the record review.</E> Ordinarily, the hearing officer makes a decision based upon review of the data and documents on which CMS based its determination of nonconformance and any other documentation submitted by any of the parties within 65 days from the date on the notice.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> The hearing officer may provide for an oral hearing either on his or her own motion or in response to a party's request if the party demonstrates to the hearing officer's satisfaction that an oral hearing is necessary. Within 30 days of receipt of the request, the hearing officer gives all known parties written notice of the request and whether the request for oral hearing is granted.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of time and place of oral hearing.</E> If the hearing officer provides an oral hearing, he or she gives all known parties written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least 30 days before the scheduled date.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Prehearing discovery.</E> (1) The hearing officer may permit prehearing discovery if it is requested by a party at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the hearing.</P>

        <P>(2) Evidence may be received at any time before the conclusion of the hearing.</P>
        <P>(3) The hearing officer gives the parties opportunity for submission and consideration of evidence and arguments and, in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, excludes irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.</P>
        <P>(4) The hearing officer's ruling on admissibility of evidence is final and not subject to further review.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Subpoenas.</E> (1) The hearing officer may, either on his or her own motion or upon the request of any party, issue subpoenas for either or both of the following if they are reasonably necessary for full presentation of the case:</P>
        <P>(i) The attendance and testimony of witnesses.</P>
        <P>(ii) The production of books, records, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are relevant and material to any matter at issue.</P>
        <P>(2) A party that wishes the issuance of a subpoena must, at least 10 days before the date fixed for the hearing, file with the hearing officer a written request that identifies the witnesses or documents to be produced and describes the address or location in sufficient detail to permit the witnesses or documents to be found.</P>
        <P>(3) The request for a subpoena must state the pertinent facts that the party expects to establish by the witnesses or documents and whether those facts could be established by other evidence without the use of a subpoena.</P>
        <P>(4) The hearing officer issues the subpoenas at his or her discretion, and CMS assumes the cost of the issuance and the fees and mileage of any subpoenaed witness, in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 405(d)).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Witnesses.</E> Witnesses at the hearing testify under oath or affirmation, unless excused by the hearing officer for cause. The hearing officer may examine the witnesses and shall allow the parties to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
        <P>This subpart sets forth special rules that apply to individuals who are eligible for, or entitled to, Medicare on the basis of ESRD. (Section 406.13 of this chapter contains the rules for eligibility and entitlement based on ESRD.)</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 411.161</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Prohibition against taking into account Medicare eligibility or entitlement or differentiating benefits.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking into account</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> A GHP may not take into account that an individual is eligible for or entitled to Medicare benefits on the basis of ESRD during the coordination period specified in § 411.162(b) and (c). Examples of actions that constitute taking into account Medicare entitlement are listed in § 411.108(a).</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This prohibition applies for ESRD-based Medicare eligibility to the same extent as for ESRD-based Medicare entitlement. An individual who has ESRD but who has not filed an application for entitlement to Medicare on that basis is eligible for Medicare based on ESRD for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) through (c)(4) of § 411.162 if the individual meets the other requirements of § 406.13 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Relation to COBRA continuation coverage.</E> This rule does not prohibit the termination of GHP coverage under title X of COBRA when termination of <PRTPAGE P="499"/>that coverage is expressly permitted, upon entitlement to Medicare, under 26 U.S.C. 4980B(f)(2)(B)(iv); 29 U.S.C. 1162.(2)(D); or 42 U.S.C. 300bb-2.(2)(D).<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/> (Situations in which Medicare is secondary to COBRA continuation coverage are set forth in § 411.162(a)(3).)</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU> COBRA requires that certain group health plans offer continuation of plan coverage for 18 to 36 months after the occurrence of certain “qualifying events,” including loss of employment or reduction of employment hours. Those are events that otherwise would result in loss of group health plan coverage unless the individual is given the opportunity to elect, and does so elect, to continue plan coverage at his or her own expense. With one exception, the COBRA amendments expressly permit termination of continuation coverage upon entitlement to Medicare. The exception is that the plan may not terminate continuation coverage of an individual (and his or her qualified dependents) if the individual retires on or before the date the employer substantially eliminates regular plan coverage by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (26 U.S.C. 4980B(g)(1)(D) and 29 U.S.C. 1167.(3)(C)).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Nondifferentiation.</E> (1) A GHP may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals who have ESRD and others enrolled in the plan, on the basis of the existence of ESRD, or the need for renal dialysis, or in any other manner.</P>
        <P>(2) GHP actions that constitute differentiation in plan benefits (and that may also constitute “taking into account” Medicare eligibility or entitlement) include, but are not limited to the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Terminating coverage of individuals with ESRD, when there is no basis for such termination unrelated to ESRD (such as failure to pay plan premiums) that would result in termination for individuals who do not have ESRD.</P>
        <P>(ii) Imposing on persons who have ESRD, but not on others enrolled in the plan, benefit limitations such as less comprehensive health plan coverage, reductions in benefits, exclusions of benefits, a higher deductible or coinsurance, a longer waiting period, a lower annual or lifetime benefit limit, or more restrictive preexisting illness limitations.</P>
        <P>(iii) Charging individuals with ESRD higher premiums.</P>
        <P>(iv) Paying providers and suppliers less for services furnished to individuals who have ESRD than for the same services furnished to those who do not have ESRD, such as paying 80 percent of the Medicare rate for renal dialysis on behalf of a plan enrollee who has ESRD and the usual, reasonable and customary charge for renal dialysis on behalf of an enrollee who does not have ESRD.</P>
        <P>(v) Failure to cover routine maintenance dialysis or kidney transplants, when a plan covers other dialysis services or other organ transplants.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Uniform Limitations on particular services permissible.</E> A plan is not prohibited from limiting covered utilization of a particular service as long as the limitation applies uniformly to all plan enrollees. For instance, if a plan limits its coverage of renal dialysis sessions to 30 per year for all plan enrollees, the plan would not be differentiating in the benefits it provides between plan enrollees who have ESRD and those who do not.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Benefits secondary to Medicare.</E> (1) The prohibition against differentiation of benefits does not preclude a plan from paying benefits secondary to Medicare after the expiration of the coordination period described in § 411.162(b) and (c), but a plan may not otherwise differentiate, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, in the benefits it provides.</P>
        <P>(2) Example—
        </P>
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>Mr. Smith works for employer A, and he and his wife are covered through employer A's GHP (Plan A). Neither is eligible for Medicare nor has ESRD. Mrs. Smith works for employer B, and is also covered by employer B's plan (Plan B). Plan A is more comprehensive than Plan B and covers certain items and services which Plan B does not cover, such as prescription drugs. If Mrs. Smith obtains a medical service, Plan B pays primary and Plan A pays secondary. That is, Plan A covers Plan B copayment amounts and items and services that Plan A covers but that Plan B does not.</P>

          <P>Mr. Jones also works for employer A, and he and his wife are covered by Plan A. Mrs. Jones does not have other GHP coverage. Mrs. Jones develops ESRD and becomes entitled to Medicare on that basis. Plan A pays primary to Medicare during the first 18 months of Medicare entitlement based on ESRD. When Medicare becomes the primary <PRTPAGE P="500"/>payer, the plan converts Mrs. Jones' coverage to a Medicare supplement policy. That policy pays Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts but does not pay for items and services not covered by Medicare, which plan A would have covered. That conversion is impermissible because the plan is providing a lower level of coverage for Mrs. Jones, who has ESRD, than it provides for Mrs. Smith, who does not. In other words, if Plan A pays secondary to primary payers other than Medicare, it must provide the same level of secondary benefits when Medicare is primary in order to comply with the nondifferentiation provision.</P>

        <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples.</E> Based on the rules specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and the rules specified in § 406.13 of this subchapter, the following examples illustrate how to determine, in different situations, the number of months during which Medicare is secondary payer.</P>
        <P>(1) An individual began dialysis on November 4, 1989. He did not initiate a course in self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he became entitled to Medicare on February 1, 1990. Since this individual began dialysis before December 1989, the 12-month period began with the first month of dialysis, November 1989, and ended October 31, 1990. The coordination period in this case is 9 months, February 1990 through October 1990.</P>
        <P>(2) An individual began dialysis on January 29, 1990. He did not initiate a course in self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he became entitled to Medicare on April 1, 1990. Since the individual began dialysis after November 1989, and became entitled to Medicare after January 1990, the coordination period began with the first month of entitlement, April 1990, and ended September 30, 1991, the end of the 18th month of entitlement.</P>
        <P>(3) An individual began a regular course of maintenance dialysis on February 10, 1990. He did not initiate a course of self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he became entitled to Medicare on May 1, 1990. Medicare is secondary payer from May 1, 1990 through October 1991, a total of 18 months.</P>
        <P>(4) The same facts exist as in the example under paragraph (d)(3), except that the individual began a course of self-dialysis training during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, the effective date of his Medicare entitlement is February 1, 1990, and Medicare is secondary payer from February 1, 1990 through July 1991, a total of 18 months.</P>

        <P>(5) An individual began dialysis on September 15, 1990. He did not initiate a course of self-dialysis training nor did he receive a kidney transplant during the first 3 calendar months of dialysis. Thus, he became entitled to <PRTPAGE P="502"/>Medicare effective December 1, 1990. Medicare is secondary payer from December 1, 1990 through May 1992, a total of 18 months.</P>
        <P>(6) An individual began dialysis on November 17, 1990. He initiates a course of self-dialysis training in January 1991, and thus becomes entitled to Medicare effective November 1, 1990. Medicare is secondary payer from November 1, 1990, through April 1992, a total of 18 months.</P>
        <P>(7) An individual began a regular course of dialysis on December 10, 1990. He does not initiate a course of self-dialysis training nor does he receive a kidney transplant. He decides to delay his enrollment in Medicare because his employer group health plan pays charges in full and he does not wish to incur part B premiums at this time. However, in March 1992, he files for part A and part B Medicare entitlement, and stipulates that he wants his Medicare entitlement to be effective March 1, 1992 (one year later than he could have become entitled). Since this individual could have been entitled to Medicare as early as March 1, 1991, Medicare is secondary payer only from March 1, 1992, through August 1992, a period of 6 months.</P>
        <FP>(While Medicare is secondary payer for only the last 6 months of this period, the Medicare program is effectively secondary payer for the full coordination period, due to the fact that the individual delayed his Medicare enrollment on account of his employer plan coverage and Medicare made no payments at all during the deferred period.)</FP>
        <P>(8) The same facts exist as in the example under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, except that the individual defers Medicare entitlement beyond August 1992. (For purposes of this example, Medicare entitlement is not retroactive, but rather takes effect after August 1992.) There would be no period during which Medicare is secondary payer in this situation. This is because Medicare entitlement does not begin until after the 18-month period expires as specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Medicare would become primary payer as of the effective date of Medicare entitlement. The employer plan is required to pay primary from December 1, 1990, through August 1992, a total of 21 months.</P>
        <P>(9) An individual becomes entitled to Medicare on December 1, 1997. The employer plan is primary payer, and Medicare is secondary payer, from December 1, 1997, through November 30, 1998, a period of 12 months. Medicare becomes primary payer on December 1, 1998, because the extension of the coordination period from 12 to 18 months applies only to items and services furnished before October 1, 1998.</P>
        <P>(10) An individual becomes entitled to Medicare on August 1, 1997. Medicare is secondary payer from August 1, 1997, through September 30, 1998, a period of 14 months. Medicare becomes primary payer on October 1, 1998, because the coordination period has expired.</P>
        <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Determinations for subsequent periods of ESRD eligibility.</E> If an individual has more than one period of eligibility based on ESRD, a coordination period will be determined for each period of eligibility in accordance with this section.</P>

        <P>(4) <E T="03">Medicare continues to be primary after an aged or disabled beneficiary becomes eligible on the basis of ESRD.</E> (i) <E T="03">Applicability of the rule.</E> Medicare remains the primary payer when an individual becomes eligible for Medicare based on ESRD if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(A) The individual is already entitled on the basis of age or disability when he or she becomes eligible on the basis of ESRD.</P>
        <P>(B) The MSP prohibition against “taking into account” age-based or disability-based entitlement does not apply because plan coverage was not “by virtue of current employment status” or the employer had fewer than 20 employees (in the case of the aged) or fewer than 100 employees (in the case of the disabled).</P>
        <P>(C) The plan is paying secondary to Medicare because the plan had justifiably taken into account the age-based or disability-based entitlement.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Effect of the rule.</E> The plan may continue to pay benefits secondary to Medicare under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. However, the plan may not differentiate in the services covered and the payments made between persons who have ESRD and those who do not.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Examples.</E> (1) (Rule (b)(1).) Mr. A, who is covered by a GHP, became entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD in January 1992. On December 20, 1992, Mr. A attained age 65 and became entitled on the basis of age. Since prior law was still in effect (OBRA '93 amendment was effective in August 1993), Medicare became primary payer as of December 1992, when dual entitlement began.</P>
        <P>(2) (Rule (b)(2).) Miss B, who has GHP coverage, became entitled to Medicare on the basis of ESRD in July 1992, and also entitled on the basis of disability in June 1993. Medicare was primary payer from June 1993 through August 9, 1993, because the plan permissibly took into account the ESRD-based entitlement (ESRD was not the “sole” basis of Medicare entitlement); secondary payer from August 10, 1993, through December 1993, the 18th month of ESRD-based entitlement (the plan is no longer permitted to take into account ESRD-based entitlement that is not the “sole” basis of Medicare entitlement); and again became primary payer beginning January 1994.</P>

        <P>(3) (Rule (b)(3).) Mr. C, who is 67 years old and entitled to Medicare on the basis of age, has GHP coverage by virtue of current employment status. Mr. C is diagnosed as having ESRD and begins a course of maintenance dialysis on June 27, 1993. Effective September 1, 1993, Mr. C. is eligible for Medicare on the basis of ESRD. Medicare, which was secondary because Mr. C's GHP coverage was by virtue of current employment, continues to be secondary payer through February 1995, the 18th month of ESRD-based eligibility, and becomes primary payer beginning March 1995.<PRTPAGE P="504"/>
        </P>
        <P>(4) (Rule (b)(3).) Mr. D retired at age 62 and maintained GHP coverage as a retiree. In January 1994, at the age of 64, Mr. D became entitled to Medicare based on ESRD. Seven months into the 18-month coordination period (July 1994) Mr. D turned age 65. The coordination period continues without regard to age-based entitlement, with the retirement plan continuing to pay primary benefits through June 1995, the 18th month of ESRD-based entitlement. Thereafter, Medicare becomes the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(5) (Rule (b)(3).) Mrs. E retired at age 62 and maintained GHP coverage as a retiree. In July 1994, she simultaneously became eligible for Medicare based on ESRD (maintenance dialysis began in April 1994) and entitled based on age. The retirement plan must pay benefits primary to Medicare from July 1994 through December 1995, the first 18 months of ESRD-based eligibility. Thereafter, Medicare becomes the primary payer.</P>
        <P>(6) (Rule (b)(3).) Mr. F, who is 67 years of age, is working and has GHP coverage because of his employment status, subsequently develops ESRD, and begins a course of maintenance dialysis in October 1994. He becomes eligible for Medicare based on ESRD effective January 1, 1995. Under the working aged provision, the plan continues to pay primary to Medicare through December 1994. On January 1, 1995, the working aged provision ceases to apply and the ESRD MSP provision takes effect. In September 1995, Mr. F retires. The GHP must ignore Mr. F's retirement status and continue to pay primary to Medicare through June 1996, the end of the 18-month coordination period.</P>
        <P>(7) (Rule (b)(4).) Mrs. G, who is 67 years of age, is retired. She has GHP retirement coverage through her former employer. Her plan permissibly took into account her age-based Medicare entitlement when she retired and is paying benefits secondary to Medicare. Mrs. G subsequently develops ESRD and begins a course of maintenance dialysis in October 1995. She automatically becomes eligible for Medicare based on ESRD effective January 1, 1996. The plan continues to be secondary on the basis of Mrs. G's age-based entitlement as long as the plan does not differentiate in the services it provides to Mrs. G and does not do anything else that would constitute “taking into account” her ESRD-based eligibility.</P>

Usually, the fair market price is the price at which <E T="03">bona fide</E> sales have been consummated for assets of like type, quality, and quantity in a particular market at the time of acquisition, or the compensation that has been included in <E T="03">bona fide</E> service agreements with comparable terms at the time of the agreement, where the price or compensation has not been determined in <PRTPAGE P="511"/>any manner that takes into account the volume or value of anticipated or actual referrals. With respect to rentals and leases described in § 411.357(a), (b), and (l) (as to equipment leases only), “fair market value” means the value of rental property for general commercial purposes (not taking into account its intended use). In the case of a lease of space, this value may not be adjusted to reflect the additional value the prospective lessee or lessor would attribute to the proximity or convenience to the lessor when the lessor is a potential source of patient referrals to the lessee. For purposes of this definition, a rental payment does not take into account intended use if it takes into account costs incurred by the lessor in developing or upgrading the property or maintaining the property or its improvements.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Single legal entity.</E> The group practice must consist of a single legal entity operating primarily for the purpose of being a physician group practice in any organizational form recognized by the State in which the group practice achieves its legal status, including, but not limited to, a partnership, professional corporation, limited liability company, foundation, nonprofit corporation, faculty practice plan, or similar association. The single legal entity may be organized by any party or parties, including, but not limited to, physicians, health care facilities, or other persons or entities (including, but not limited to, physicians individually incorporated as professional corporations). The single legal entity may be organized or owned (in whole or in part) by another medical practice, provided that the other medical practice is not an operating physician practice (and regardless of whether the medical practice meets the conditions for a group practice under this section). For purposes of this subpart, a single legal entity does not include informal affiliations of physicians formed substantially to share profits from referrals, or separate group practices under common ownership or control through a physician practice management company, hospital, health system, or other entity or organization. A group practice that is otherwise a single legal entity may itself own subsidiary entities.

        <P>(1) The States in which the group practice is operating are contiguous (although each State need not be contiguous to every other State);</P>
        <P>(2) The legal entities are absolutely identical as to ownership, governance, and operation; and</P>
        <P>(3) Organization of the group practice into multiple entities is necessary to comply with jurisdictional licensing laws of the States in which the group practice operates.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Physicians.</E> The group practice must have at least two physicians who are members of the group (whether employees or direct or indirect owners), as defined at § 411.351.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Range of care.</E> Each physician who is a member of the group, as defined at § 411.351, must furnish substantially the full range of patient care services that the physician routinely furnishes, including medical care, consultation, diagnosis, and treatment, through the joint use of shared office space, facilities, equipment, and personnel.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Services furnished by group practice members.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section, substantially all of the patient care services of the physicians who are members of the group (that is, at least 75 percent of the total patient care services of the group practice members) must be furnished through the group and billed under a billing number assigned to the group, and the amounts received must be treated as receipts of the group. <E T="03">Patient care services</E> must be measured by one of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The total time each member spends on patient care services documented by any reasonable means (including, but not limited to, time cards, appointment schedules, or personal diaries). (For example, if a physician practices 40 hours a week and spends 30 hours a week on patient care services for a group practice, the physician has spent 75 percent of his or her time providing patient care services for the group.)</P>
        <P>(ii) Any alternative measure that is reasonable, fixed in advance of the performance of the services being measured, uniformly applied over time, verifiable, and documented.</P>
        <P>(2) The data used to calculate compliance with this <E T="03">substantially all</E> test and related supportive documentation must be made available to the Secretary upon request.</P>
        <P>(3) The <E T="03">substantially all</E> test set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to any group practice that is located solely in a HPSA, as defined at § 411.351.</P>

        <P>(4) For a group practice located outside of a HPSA (as defined at § 411.351), any time spent by a group practice <PRTPAGE P="518"/>member providing services in a HPSA should not be used to calculate whether the group practice has met the <E T="03">substantially all</E> test, regardless of whether the member's time in the HPSA is spent in a group practice, clinic, or office setting.</P>
        <P>(5) During the <E T="03">start up</E> period (not to exceed 12 months) that begins on the date of the initial formation of a new group practice, a group practice must make a reasonable, good faith effort to ensure that the group practice complies with the <E T="03">substantially all</E> test requirement set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as soon as practicable, but no later than 12 months from the date of the initial formation of the group practice. This paragraph (d)(5) does not apply when an existing group practice admits a new member or reorganizes.</P>

        <P>(6)(i) If the addition to an existing group practice of a new member who would be considered to have relocated his or her medical practice under § 411.357(e)(2) would result in the existing group practice not meeting the <E T="03">substantially all</E> test set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the group practice will have 12 months following the addition of the new member to come back into full compliance, provided that—</P>

        <P>(A) For the 12-month period the group practice is fully compliant with the <E T="03">substantially all</E> test if the new member is not counted as a member of the group for purposes of § 411.352; and</P>
        <P>(B) The new member's employment with, or ownership interest in, the group practice is documented in writing no later than the beginning of his or her new employment, ownership, or investment.</P>
        <P>(ii) This paragraph (d)(6) does not apply when an existing group practice reorganizes or admits a new member who is not relocating his or her medical practice.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Distribution of expenses and income.</E> The overhead expenses of, and income from, the practice must be distributed according to methods that are determined before the receipt of payment for the services giving rise to the overhead expense or producing the income. Nothing in this section prevents a group practice from adjusting its compensation methodology prospectively, subject to restrictions on the distribution of revenue from DHS under § 411.352(i).</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Unified business.</E> (1) The group practice must be a unified business having at least the following features:</P>
        <P>(i) Centralized decision-making by a body representative of the group practice that maintains effective control over the group's assets and liabilities (including, but not limited to, budgets, compensation, and salaries); and</P>
        <P>(ii) Consolidated billing, accounting, and financial reporting.</P>
        <P>(2) Location and specialty-based compensation practices are permitted with respect to revenues derived from services that are not DHS and may be permitted with respect to revenues derived from DHS under § 411.352(i).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Volume or value of referrals.</E> No physician who is a member of the group practice directly or indirectly receives compensation based on the volume or value of his or her referrals, except as provided in § 411.352(i).</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Physician-patient encounters.</E> Members of the group must personally conduct no less than 75 percent of the physician-patient encounters of the group practice.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Special rule for productivity bonuses and profit shares.</E> (1) A physician in the group practice may be paid a share of overall profits of the group, provided that the share is not determined in any manner that is directly related to the volume or value of referrals of DHS by the physician. A physician in the group practice may be paid a productivity bonus based on services that he or she has personally performed, or services “incident to” such personally performed services, or both, provided that the bonus is not determined in any manner that is directly related to the volume or value of referrals of DHS by the physician (except that the bonus may directly relate to the volume or value of DHS referrals by the physician if the referrals are for services “incident to” the physician's personally performed services).</P>

        <P>(2) Overall profits means the group's entire profits derived from DHS payable by Medicare or Medicaid or the profits derived from DHS payable by Medicare or Medicaid of any component of the group practice that consists <PRTPAGE P="519"/>of at least five physicians. Overall profits should be divided in a reasonable and verifiable manner that is not directly related to the volume or value of the physician's referrals of DHS. The share of overall profits will be deemed <E T="03">not</E> to relate directly to the volume or value of referrals if <E T="03">one</E> of the following conditions is met:</P>
        <P>(i) The group's profits are divided per capita (for example, per member of the group or per physician in the group).</P>
        <P>(ii) Revenues derived from DHS are distributed based on the distribution of the group practice's revenues attributed to services that are not DHS payable by any Federal health care program or private payer.</P>
        <P>(iii) Revenues derived from DHS constitute less than 5 percent of the group practice's total revenues, and the allocated portion of those revenues to each physician in the group practice constitutes 5 percent or less of his or her total compensation from the group.</P>
        <P>(3) A productivity bonus must be calculated in a reasonable and verifiable manner that is not directly related to the volume or value of the physician's referrals of DHS. A productivity bonus will be deemed not to relate directly to the volume or value of referrals of DHS if one of the following conditions is met:</P>
        <P>(i) The bonus is based on the physician's total patient encounters or relative value units (RVUs). (The methodology for establishing RVUs is set forth in § 414.22 of this chapter.)</P>
        <P>(ii) The bonus is based on the allocation of the physician's compensation attributable to services that are not DHS payable by any Federal health care program or private payer.</P>
        <P>(iii) Revenues derived from DHS are less than 5 percent of the group practice's total revenues, and the allocated portion of those revenues to each physician in the group practice constitutes 5 percent or less of his or her total compensation from the group practice.</P>
        <P>(4) Supporting documentation verifying the method used to calculate the profit share or productivity bonus under paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, and the resulting amount of compensation, must be made available to the Secretary upon request.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Prohibition on certain referrals by physicians and limitations on billing.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Prohibition on referrals.</E> Except as provided in this subpart, a physician who has a direct or indirect financial relationship with an entity, or who has an immediate family member who has a direct or indirect financial relationship with the entity, may not make a referral to that entity for the furnishing of DHS for which payment otherwise may be made under Medicare. A physician's prohibited financial relationship with an entity that furnishes DHS is not imputed to his or her group practice or its members or its staff. However, a referral made by a physician's group practice, its members, or its staff may be imputed to the physician if the physician directs the group practice, its members, or its staff to make the referral or if the physician controls referrals made by his or her group practice, its members, or its staff.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations on billing.</E> An entity that furnishes DHS pursuant to a referral that is prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section may not present or cause to be presented a claim or bill to the Medicare program or to any individual, third party payer, or other entity for the DHS performed pursuant to the prohibited referral.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Denial of payment for services furnished under a prohibited referral.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, no Medicare payment may be made for a designated health service that is furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. The period during which referrals are prohibited is the period of disallowance. For purposes of this section, with respect to the following types of noncompliance, the period of disallowance begins at the time the financial relationship fails to satisfy the requirements of an applicable exception and ends no later than—</P>
        <P>(i) Where the noncompliance is unrelated to compensation, the date that the financial relationship satisfies all of the requirements of an applicable exception;</P>

        <P>(ii) Where the noncompliance is due to the payment of excess compensation, the date on which all excess compensation is returned by the party that <PRTPAGE P="520"/>received it to the party that paid it and the financial relationship satisfies all of the requirements of an applicable exception; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Where the noncompliance is due to the payment of compensation that is of an amount insufficient to satisfy the requirements of an applicable exception, the date on which all additional required compensation is paid by the party that owes it to the party to which it is owed and the financial relationship satisfies all of the requirements of an applicable exception.</P>
        <P>(2) When payment for a designated health service is denied on the basis that the service was furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, and such payment denial is appealed—</P>
        <P>(i) The ultimate burden of proof (burden of persuasion) at each level of appeal is on the entity submitting the claim for payment to establish that the service was not furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral (and not on CMS or its contractors to establish that the service was furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral); and</P>
        <P>(ii) The burden of production on each issue at each level of appeal is initially on the claimant, but may shift to CMS or its contractors during the course of the appellate proceeding, depending on the evidence presented by the claimant.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Refunds.</E> An entity that collects payment for a designated health service that was performed pursuant to a prohibited referral must refund all collected amounts on a timely basis, as defined at § 1003.101 of this title.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Exception for certain entities.</E> Payment may be made to an entity that submits a claim for a designated health service if—</P>
        <P>(1) The entity did not have actual knowledge of, and did not act in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of, the identity of the physician who made the referral of the designated health service to the entity; and</P>
        <P>(2) The claim otherwise complies with all applicable Federal and State laws, rules, and regulations.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Exception for certain arrangements involving temporary noncompliance.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2), (f)(3), and (f)(4) of this section, an entity may submit a claim or bill and payment may be made to an entity that submits a claim or bill for a designated health service if—</P>
        <P>(i) The financial relationship between the entity and the referring physician fully complied with an applicable exception under § 411.355, § 411.356, or § 411.357 for at least 180 consecutive calendar days immediately preceding the date on which the financial relationship became noncompliant with the exception;</P>
        <P>(ii) The financial relationship has fallen out of compliance with the exception for reasons beyond the control of the entity, and the entity promptly takes steps to rectify the noncompliance; and</P>
        <P>(iii) The financial relationship does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), and the claim or bill otherwise complies with all applicable Federal and State laws, rules, and regulations.</P>
        <P>(2) Paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies only to DHS furnished during the period of time it takes the entity to rectify the noncompliance, which must not exceed 90 consecutive calendar days following the date on which the financial relationship became noncompliant with an exception.</P>
        <P>(3) Paragraph (f)(1) may be used by an entity only once every 3 years with respect to the same referring physician.</P>
        <P>(4) Paragraph (f)(1) does not apply if the exception with which the financial relationship previously complied was § 411.357(k) or (m).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Special rule for certain arrangements involving temporary noncompliance with signature requirements.</E> (1) An entity may submit a claim or bill and payment may be made to an entity that submits a claim or bill for a designated health service if—</P>
        <P>(i) The compensation arrangement between the entity and the referring physician fully complies with an applicable exception in this subpart except with respect to the signature requirement of the exception; and</P>

        <P>(ii) The parties obtain the required signature(s) within 90 consecutive calendar days immediately following the date on which the compensation arrangement became noncompliant and <PRTPAGE P="521"/>the compensation arrangement otherwise complies with all criteria of the applicable exception.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Financial relationships.</E> (1) <E T="03">Financial relationship</E> means—</P>
        <P>(i) A direct or indirect ownership or investment interest (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) in any entity that furnishes DHS; or</P>
        <P>(ii) A direct or indirect compensation arrangement (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) with an entity that furnishes DHS.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Types of financial relationships.</E> (i) A <E T="03">direct</E> financial relationship exists if remuneration passes between the referring physician (or a member of his or her immediate family) and the entity furnishing DHS without any intervening persons or entities between the entity furnishing DHS and the referring physician (or a member of his or her immediate family).</P>
        <P>(ii) An <E T="03">indirect</E> financial relationship exists under the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(5) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Ownership or investment interest.</E> An ownership or investment interest in the entity may be through equity, debt, or other means, and includes an interest in an entity that holds an ownership or investment interest in any entity that furnishes DHS.</P>
        <P>(1) An ownership or investment interest includes, but is not limited to, stock, stock options other than those described in § 411.354(b)(3)(ii), partnership shares, limited liability company memberships, as well as loans, bonds, or other financial instruments that are secured with an entity's property or revenue or a portion of that property or revenue.</P>
        <P>(2) An ownership or investment interest in a subsidiary company is neither an ownership or investment interest in the parent company, nor in any other subsidiary of the parent, unless the subsidiary company itself has an ownership or investment interest in the parent or such other subsidiaries. It may, however, be part of an indirect financial relationship.</P>
        <P>(3) Ownership and investment interests do not include, among other things—</P>
        <P>(i) An interest in an entity that arises from a retirement plan offered by that entity to the physician (or a member of his or her immediate family) through the physician's (or immediate family member's) employment with that entity;</P>
        <P>(ii) Stock options and convertible securities received as compensation until the stock options are exercised or the convertible securities are converted to equity (before this time the stock options or convertible securities are compensation arrangements as defined in paragraph (c) of this section);</P>
        <P>(iii) An unsecured loan subordinated to a credit facility (which is a compensation arrangement as defined in paragraph (c) of this section);</P>
        <P>(iv) An “under arrangements” contract between a hospital and an entity owned by one or more physicians (or a group of physicians) providing DHS “under arrangements” with the hospital (such a contract is a compensation arrangement as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); or</P>
        <P>(v) A security interest held by a physician in equipment sold by the physician to a hospital and financed through a loan from the physician to the hospital (such an interest is a compensation arrangement as defined in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
        <P>(4) An ownership or investment interest that meets an exception set forth in § 411.355 or § 411.356 need not also meet an exception for compensation arrangements set forth in § 411.357 with respect to profit distributions, dividends, or interest payments on secured obligations.</P>
        <P>(5)(i) An <E T="03">indirect ownership or investment interest</E> exists if—</P>

        <P>(A) Between the referring physician (or immediate family member) and the entity furnishing DHS there exists an unbroken chain of any number (but no fewer than one) of persons or entities having ownership or investment interests; and<PRTPAGE P="522"/>
        </P>
        <P>(B) The entity furnishing DHS has actual knowledge of, or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of, the fact that the referring physician (or immediate family member) has some ownership or investment interest (through any number of intermediary ownership or investment interests) in the entity furnishing the DHS.</P>
        <P>(ii) An indirect ownership or investment interest exists even though the entity furnishing DHS does not know, or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of, the precise composition of the unbroken chain or the specific terms of the ownership or investment interests that form the links in the chain.</P>
        <P>(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (b)(5), common ownership or investment in an entity does not, in and of itself, establish an indirect ownership or investment interest by one common owner or investor in another common owner or investor.</P>

        <P>(iv) An indirect ownership or investment interest requires an unbroken chain of ownership interests between the referring physician and the entity furnishing DHS such that the referring physician has an indirect ownership or investment interest <E T="03">in</E> the entity furnishing DHS.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Compensation arrangement.</E> A compensation arrangement is any arrangement involving remuneration, direct or indirect, between a physician (or a member of a physician's immediate family) and an entity. An “under arrangements” contract between a hospital and an entity providing DHS “under arrangements” to the hospital creates a compensation arrangement for purposes of these regulations. A compensation arrangement does not include the portion of any business arrangement that consists solely of the remuneration described in section 1877(h)(1)(C) of the Act and in paragraphs (1) through (3) of the definition of the term “remuneration” at § 411.351. (However, any other portion of the arrangement may still constitute a compensation arrangement.)</P>
        <P>(1)(i) A direct compensation arrangement exists if remuneration passes between the referring physician (or a member of his or her immediate family) and the entity furnishing DHS without any intervening persons or entities.</P>
        <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, a physician is deemed to “stand in the shoes” of his or her physician organization and have a direct compensation arrangement with an entity furnishing DHS if—</P>
        <P>(A) The only intervening entity between the physician and the entity furnishing DHS is his or her physician organization; and</P>
        <P>(B) The physician has an ownership or investment interest in the physician organization.</P>
        <P>(iii) A physician (other than a physician described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) is permitted to “stand in the shoes” of his or her physician organization and have a direct compensation arrangement with an entity furnishing DHS if the only intervening entity between the physician and the entity furnishing DHS is his or her physician organization.</P>
        <P>(2) An <E T="03">indirect compensation arrangement</E> exists if—</P>
        <P>(i) Between the referring physician (or a member of his or her immediate family) and the entity furnishing DHS there exists an unbroken chain of any number (but not fewer than one) of persons or entities that have financial relationships (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) between them (that is, each link in the chain has either an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement with the preceding link);</P>

        <P>(ii) The referring physician (or immediate family member) receives aggregate compensation from the person or entity in the chain with which the physician (or immediate family member) has a direct financial relationship that varies with, or takes into account, the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing the DHS, regardless of whether the individual unit of compensation satisfies the special rules on unit-based compensation under paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section. If the financial relationship between the physician (or immediate family member) and the person or entity in the chain with <PRTPAGE P="523"/>which the referring physician (or immediate family member) has a direct financial relationship is an ownership or investment interest, the determination whether the aggregate compensation varies with, or takes into account, the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing the DHS will be measured by the nonownership or noninvestment interest closest to the referring physician (or immediate family member). (For example, if a referring physician has an ownership interest in company A, which owns company B, which has a compensation arrangement with company C, which has a compensation arrangement with entity D that furnishes DHS, we would look to the aggregate compensation between company B and company C for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)); and</P>
        <P>(iii) The entity furnishing DHS has actual knowledge of, or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of, the fact that the referring physician (or immediate family member) receives aggregate compensation that varies with, or takes into account, the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing the DHS.</P>
        <P>(iv)(A) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, a physician is deemed to “stand in the shoes” of his or her physician organization if the physician has an ownership or investment interest in the physician organization.</P>
        <P>(B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a physician (other than a physician described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section) is permitted to “stand in the shoes” of his or her physician organization.</P>
        <P>(3)(i) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a physician who “stands in the shoes” of his or her physician organization is deemed to have the same compensation arrangements (with the same parties and on the same terms) as the physician organization. When applying the exceptions in §§ 411.355 and 411.357 to arrangements in which a physician stands in the shoes of his or her physician organization, the “parties to the arrangements” are considered to be—</P>
        <P>(A) With respect to a signature requirement, the physician organization and any physician who “stands in the shoes” of the physician organization as required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(B) With respect to all other requirements of the exception, including the relevant referrals and other business generated between the parties, the entity furnishing DHS and the physician organization (including all members, employees, and independent contractor physicians).</P>
        <P>(ii) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section—</P>
        <P>(A) Need not apply during the original term or current renewal term of an arrangement that satisfied the requirements of § 411.357(p) as of September 5, 2007 (see 42 CFR parts 400-413, revised as of October 1, 2007);</P>
        <P>(B) Do not apply to an arrangement that satisfies the requirements of § 411.355(e); and</P>
        <P>(C) Do not apply to a physician whose ownership or investment interest is titular only. A titular ownership or investment interest is an ownership or investment interest that excludes the ability or right to receive the financial benefits of ownership or investment, including, but not limited to, the distribution of profits, dividends, proceeds of sale, or similar returns on investment.</P>
        <P>(iii) An arrangement structured to comply with an exception in § 411.357 (other than § 411.357(p)), but which would otherwise qualify as an indirect compensation arrangement under this paragraph as of August 19, 2008, need not be restructured to satisfy the requirements of § 411.357(p) until the expiration of the original term or current renewal term of the arrangement.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rules on compensation.</E> The following special rules apply only to compensation under section 1877 of the Act and subpart J of this part:</P>

        <P>(1) Compensation is considered “set in advance” if the aggregate compensation, a time-based or per-unit of service-based (whether per-use or per-service) amount, or a specific formula for calculating the compensation is set out <PRTPAGE P="524"/>in writing before the furnishing of the items or services for which the compensation is to be paid. The formula for determining the compensation must be set forth in sufficient detail so that it can be objectively verified, and the formula may not be changed or modified during the course of the arrangement in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</P>
        <P>(2) Unit-based compensation (including time-based or per-unit of service-based compensation) is deemed not to take into account “the volume or value of referrals” if the compensation is fair market value for services or items actually provided and does not vary during the course of the compensation arrangement in any manner that takes into account referrals of DHS.</P>
        <P>(3) Unit-based compensation (including time-based or per-unit of service-based compensation) is deemed not to take into account “other business generated between the parties,” provided that the compensation is fair market value for items and services actually provided and does not vary during the course of the compensation arrangement in any manner that takes into account referrals or other business generated by the referring physician, including private pay health care business (except for services personally performed by the referring physician, which are not considered “other business generated” by the referring physician).</P>
        <P>(4) A physician's compensation from a bona fide employer or under a managed care contract or other arrangement for personal services may be conditioned on the physician's referrals to a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier, provided that the compensation arrangement meets all of the following conditions. The compensation arrangement:</P>
        <P>(i) Is set in advance for the term of the arrangement.</P>
        <P>(ii) Is consistent with fair market value for services performed (that is, the payment does not take into account the volume or value of anticipated or required referrals).</P>
        <P>(iii) Otherwise complies with an applicable exception under § 411.355 or § 411.357.</P>

        <P>(3) The space rented or leased does not exceed that which is reasonable and necessary for the legitimate business purposes of the lease arrangement and is used exclusively by the lessee when being used by the lessee (and is not shared with or used by the lessor or any person or entity related to the lessor), except that the lessee may make payments for the use of space consisting of common areas if the payments do not exceed the lessee's pro rata share of expenses for the space based upon the ratio of the space used exclusively by the lessee to the total amount of space (other than common areas) occupied by all persons using the common areas.</P>
        <P>(4) The rental charges over the term of the lease arrangement are set in advance and are consistent with fair market value.</P>
        <P>(5) The rental charges over the term of the lease arrangement are not determined—</P>

        <P>(B) Per-unit of service rental charges, to the extent that such charges reflect services provided to patients referred by the lessor to the lessee.</P>
        <P>(6) The lease arrangement would be commercially reasonable even if no referrals were made between the lessee and the lessor.</P>
        <P>(7) If the lease arrangement expires after a term of at least 1 year, a holdover lease arrangement immediately following the expiration of the lease arrangement satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the following conditions are met:</P>

        <P>(B) Per-unit of service rental charges, to the extent that such charges reflect services provided to patients referred by the lessor to the lessee.</P>
        <P>(5) The lease arrangement would be commercially reasonable even if no referrals were made between the parties.</P>
        <P>(6) If the lease arrangement expires after a term of at least 1 year, a holdover lease arrangement immediately following the expiration of the lease arrangement satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if the following conditions are met:</P>

        <P>(4) Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section does not prohibit payment of remuneration in the form of a productivity bonus based on services performed personally by the physician (or immediate family member of the physician).</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Personal service arrangements.</E> (1) <E T="03">General</E>—Remuneration from an entity under an arrangement or multiple arrangements to a physician or his or her immediate family member, or to a group practice, including remuneration for specific physician services furnished to a nonprofit blood center, if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(i) Each arrangement is set out in writing, is signed by the parties, and specifies the services covered by the arrangement.</P>

        <P>(ii) The arrangement(s) covers all of the services to be furnished by the physician (or an immediate family member of the physician) to the entity. This requirement is met if all separate arrangements between the entity and the physician and the entity and any family members incorporate each other by reference or if they cross-reference a <PRTPAGE P="533"/>master list of contracts that is maintained and updated centrally and is available for review by the Secretary upon request. The master list must be maintained in a manner that preserves the historical record of contracts. A physician or family member can “furnish” services through employees whom they have hired for the purpose of performing the services; through a wholly-owned entity; or through <E T="03">locum tenens</E> physicians (as defined at § 411.351, except that the regular physician need not be a member of a group practice).</P>
        <P>(iii) The aggregate services covered by the arrangement do not exceed those that are reasonable and necessary for the legitimate business purposes of the arrangement(s).</P>
        <P>(iv) The duration of each arrangement is at least 1 year. To meet this requirement, if an arrangement is terminated with or without cause, the parties may not enter into the same or substantially the same arrangement during the first year of the original arrangement.</P>
        <P>(v) The compensation to be paid over the term of each arrangement is set in advance, does not exceed fair market value, and, except in the case of a physician incentive plan (as defined at § 411.351 of this subpart), is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties.</P>
        <P>(vi) The services to be furnished under each arrangement do not involve the counseling or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity that violates any Federal or State law.</P>
        <P>(vii) If the arrangement expires after a term of at least 1 year, a holdover arrangement immediately following the expiration of the arrangement satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(A) The arrangement met the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section when the arrangement expired;</P>
        <P>(B) The holdover arrangement is on the same terms and conditions as the immediately preceding arrangement; and</P>
        <P>(C) The holdover arrangement continues to satisfy the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Physician incentive plan exception.</E> In the case of a physician incentive plan (as defined at § 411.351) between a physician and an entity (or downstream contractor), the compensation may be determined in a manner (through a withhold, capitation, bonus, or otherwise) that takes into account directly or indirectly the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties, if the plan meets the following requirements:</P>
        <P>(i) No specific payment is made directly or indirectly under the plan to a physician or a physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished with respect to a specific individual enrolled with the entity.</P>
        <P>(ii) Upon request of the Secretary, the entity provides the Secretary with access to information regarding the plan (including any downstream contractor plans), in order to permit the Secretary to determine whether the plan is in compliance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) In the case of a plan that places a physician or a physician group at substantial financial risk as defined at § 422.208, the entity or any downstream contractor (or both) complies with the requirements concerning physician incentive plans set forth in § 422.208 and § 422.210 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Physician recruitment.</E> (1) Remuneration provided by a hospital to recruit a physician that is paid directly to the physician and that is intended to induce the physician to relocate his or her medical practice to the geographic area served by the hospital in order to become a member of the hospital's medical staff, if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(i) The arrangement is set out in writing and signed by both parties;</P>

        <P>(ii) The arrangement is not conditioned on the physician's referral of patients to the hospital;<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
        </P>
        <P>(iii) The amount of remuneration under the arrangement is not determined in a manner that takes into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any actual or anticipated referrals by the physician or other business generated between the parties; and</P>
        <P>(iv) The physician is allowed to establish staff privileges at any other hospital(s) and to refer business to any other entities (except as referrals may be restricted under an employment or services arrangement that complies with § 411.354(d)(4)).</P>
        <P>(2)(i) The “geographic area served by the hospital” is the area composed of the lowest number of contiguous zip codes from which the hospital draws at least 75 percent of its inpatients. The geographic area served by the hospital may include one or more zip codes from which the hospital draws no inpatients, provided that such zip codes are entirely surrounded by zip codes in the geographic area described above from which the hospital draws at least 75 percent of its inpatients.</P>
        <P>(ii) With respect to a hospital that draws fewer than 75 percent of its inpatients from all of the contiguous zip codes from which it draws inpatients, the “geographic area served by the hospital” will be deemed to be the area composed of all of the contiguous zip codes from which the hospital draws its inpatients.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special optional rule for rural hospitals.</E> In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (as defined at § 411.351), the “geographic area served by the hospital” may also be the area composed of the lowest number of contiguous zip codes from which the hospital draws at least 90 percent of its inpatients. If the hospital draws fewer than 90 percent of its inpatients from all of the contiguous zip codes from which it draws inpatients, the “geographic area served by the hospital” may include noncontiguous zip codes, beginning with the noncontiguous zip code in which the highest percentage of the hospital's inpatients resides, and continuing to add noncontiguous zip codes in decreasing order of percentage of inpatients.</P>
        <P>(iv) A physician will be considered to have relocated his or her medical practice if the medical practice was located outside the geographic area served by the hospital and—</P>
        <P>(A) The physician moves his or her medical practice at least 25 miles and into the geographic area served by the hospital; or</P>
        <P>(B) The physician moves his medical practice into the geographic area served by the hospital, and the physician's new medical practice derives at least 75 percent of its revenues from professional services furnished to patients (including hospital inpatients) not seen or treated by the physician at his or her prior medical practice site during the preceding 3 years, measured on an annual basis (fiscal or calendar year). For the initial “start up” year of the recruited physician's practice, the 75 percent test in the preceding sentence will be satisfied if there is a reasonable expectation that the recruited physician's medical practice for the year will derive at least 75 percent of its revenues from professional services furnished to patients not seen or treated by the physician at his or her prior medical practice site during the preceding 3 years.</P>
        <P>(3) The recruited physician will not be subject to the relocation requirement of this paragraph, provided that he or she establishes his or her medical practice in the geographic area served by the recruiting hospital, if—</P>
        <P>(i) He or she is a resident or physician who has been in practice 1 year or less;</P>
        <P>(ii) He or she was employed on a full-time basis for at least 2 years immediately prior to the recruitment arrangement by one of the following (and did not maintain a private practice in addition to such full-time employment):</P>
        <P>(A) A Federal or State bureau of prisons (or similar entity operating one or more correctional facilities) to serve a prison population;</P>
        <P>(B) The Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs to serve active or veteran military personnel and their families; or</P>
        <P>(C) A facility of the Indian Health Service to serve patients who receive medical care exclusively through the Indian Health Service; or</P>

        <P>(iii) The Secretary has deemed in an advisory opinion issued under section <PRTPAGE P="535"/>1877(g) of the Act that the physician does not have an established medical practice that serves or could serve a significant number of patients who are or could become patients of the recruiting hospital.</P>
        <P>(4) In the case of remuneration provided by a hospital to a physician either indirectly through payments made to another physician practice, or directly to a physician who joins a physician practice, the following additional conditions must be met:</P>
        <P>(i) The writing in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is also signed by the physician practice.</P>
        <P>(ii) Except for actual costs incurred by the physician practice in recruiting the new physician, the remuneration is passed directly through to or remains with the recruited physician.</P>
        <P>(iii) In the case of an income guarantee of any type made by the hospital to a recruited physician who joins a physician practice, the costs allocated by the physician practice to the recruited physician do not exceed the actual additional incremental costs attributable to the recruited physician. With respect to a physician recruited to join a physician practice located in a rural area or HPSA, if the physician is recruited to replace a physician who, within the previous 12-month period, retired, relocated outside of the geographic area served by the hospital, or died, the costs allocated by the physician practice to the recruited physician do not exceed either—</P>
        <P>(A) The actual additional incremental costs attributable to the recruited physician; or</P>
        <P>(B) The lower of a <E T="03">per capita</E> allocation or 20 percent of the practice's aggregate costs.</P>
        <P>(iv) Records of the actual costs and the passed-through amounts are maintained for a period of at least 6 years and made available to the Secretary upon request.</P>
        <P>(v) The remuneration from the hospital under the arrangement is not determined in a manner that takes into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any actual or anticipated referrals by the recruited physician or the physician practice (or any physician affiliated with the physician practice) receiving the direct payments from the hospital.</P>
        <P>(vi) The physician practice may not impose on the recruited physician practice restrictions that unreasonably restrict the recruited physician's ability to practice medicine in the geographic area served by the hospital.</P>
        <P>(vii) The arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>
        <P>(5) Recruitment of a physician by a hospital located in a rural area (as defined at § 411.351) to an area outside the geographic area served by the hospital is permitted under this exception if the Secretary determines in an advisory opinion issued under section 1877(g) of the Act that the area has a demonstrated need for the recruited physician and all other requirements of this paragraph (e) are met.</P>
        <P>(6)(i) This paragraph (e) applies to remuneration provided by a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic in the same manner as it applies to remuneration provided by a hospital, provided that the arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>
        <P>(ii) The “geographic area served” by a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic is the area composed of the lowest number of contiguous or noncontiguous zip codes from which the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic draws at least 90 percent of its patients, as determined on an encounter basis. The geographic area served by the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic may include one or more zip codes from which the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic draws no patients, provided that such zip codes are entirely surrounded by zip codes in the geographic area described above from which the federally qualified health center or rural health clinic draws at least 90 percent of its patients.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Isolated transactions.</E> Isolated financial transactions, such as a one-<PRTPAGE P="536"/>time sale of property or a practice, if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(1) The amount of remuneration under the isolated transaction is—</P>
        <P>(i) Consistent with the fair market value of the transaction; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Not determined in a manner that takes into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any referrals by the referring physician or other business generated between the parties.</P>
        <P>(2) The remuneration is provided under an arrangement that would be commercially reasonable even if the physician made no referrals to the entity.</P>
        <P>(3) There are no additional transactions between the parties for 6 months after the isolated transaction, except for transactions that are specifically excepted under the other provisions in § 411.355 through § 411.357 and except for commercially reasonable post-closing adjustments that do not take into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Certain arrangements with hospitals.</E> Remuneration provided by a hospital to a physician if the remuneration does not relate, directly or indirectly, to the furnishing of DHS. To qualify as “unrelated,” remuneration must be wholly unrelated to the furnishing of DHS and must not in any way take into account the volume or value of a physician's referrals. Remuneration relates to the furnishing of DHS if it—</P>
        <P>(1) Is an item, service, or cost that could be allocated in whole or in part to Medicare or Medicaid under cost reporting principles;</P>
        <P>(2) Is furnished, directly or indirectly, explicitly or implicitly, in a selective, targeted, preferential, or conditioned manner to medical staff or other persons in a position to make or influence referrals; or</P>
        <P>(3) Otherwise takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Group practice arrangements with a hospital.</E> An arrangement between a hospital and a group practice under which DHS are furnished by the group but are billed by the hospital if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(1) With respect to services furnished to an inpatient of the hospital, the arrangement is pursuant to the provision of inpatient hospital services under section 1861(b)(3) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(2) The arrangement began before, and has continued in effect without interruption since, December 19, 1989.</P>
        <P>(3) With respect to the DHS covered under the arrangement, at least 75 percent of these services furnished to patients of the hospital are furnished by the group under the arrangement.</P>
        <P>(4) The arrangement is in accordance with a written agreement that specifies the services to be furnished by the parties and the compensation for services furnished under the agreement.</P>
        <P>(5) The compensation paid over the term of the agreement is consistent with fair market value, and the compensation per unit of service is fixed in advance and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties.</P>
        <P>(6) The compensation is provided in accordance with an agreement that would be commercially reasonable even if no referrals were made to the entity.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Payments by a physician.</E> Payments made by a physician (or his or her immediate family member)—</P>
        <P>(1) To a laboratory in exchange for the provision of clinical laboratory services; or</P>
        <P>(2) To an entity as compensation for any other items or services that are furnished at a price that is consistent with fair market value, and that are not specifically excepted by another provision in §§ 411.355 through 411.357 (including, but not limited to, § 411.357(l)). “Services” in this context means services of any kind (not merely those defined as “services” for purposes of the Medicare program in § 400.202 of this chapter).</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Charitable donations by a physician. Bona fide</E> charitable donations made by a physician (or immediate family member) to an entity if all of the following conditions are satisfied:<PRTPAGE P="537"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1) The charitable donation is made to an organization exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code (or to a supporting organization);</P>
        <P>(2) The donation is neither solicited, nor offered, in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between the physician and the entity; and</P>
        <P>(3) The donation arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>
        <P>(k) <E T="03">Nonmonetary compensation.</E> (1) Compensation from an entity in the form of items or services (not including cash or cash equivalents) that does not exceed an aggregate of $300 per calendar year, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this section, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
        <P>(i) The compensation is not determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician.</P>
        <P>(ii) The compensation may not be solicited by the physician or the physician's practice (including employees and staff members).</P>
        <P>(iii) The compensation arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act) or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>

        <P>(2) The annual aggregate nonmonetary compensation limit in this paragraph (k) is adjusted each calendar year to the nearest whole dollar by the increase in the Consumer Price Index—Urban All Items (CPI-U) for the 12-month period ending the preceding September 30. CMS displays after September 30 each year both the increase in the CPI-U for the 12-month period and the new nonmonetary compensation limit on the physician self-referral Web site at <E T="03">http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianSelfReferral/10_CPI-U_Updates.asp</E>.</P>
        <P>(3) Where an entity has inadvertently provided nonmonetary compensation to a physician in excess of the limit (as set forth in paragraph (k)(1) of this section), such compensation is deemed to be within the limit if—</P>
        <P>(i) The value of the excess nonmonetary compensation is no more than 50 percent of the limit; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The physician returns to the entity the excess nonmonetary compensation (or an amount equal to the value of the excess nonmonetary compensation) by the end of the calendar year in which the excess nonmonetary compensation was received or within 180 consecutive calendar days following the date the excess nonmonetary compensation was received by the physician, whichever is earlier.</P>
        <P>(iii) Paragraph (k)(3) may be used by an entity only once every 3 years with respect to the same referring physician.</P>
        <P>(4) In addition to nonmonetary compensation up to the limit described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, an entity that has a formal medical staff may provide one local medical staff appreciation event per year for the entire medical staff. Any gifts or gratuities provided in connection with the medical staff appreciation event are subject to the limit in paragraph (k)(1).</P>
        <P>(l) <E T="03">Fair market value compensation</E>. Compensation resulting from an arrangement between an entity and a physician (or an immediate family member) or any group of physicians (regardless of whether the group meets the definition of a group practice set forth in § 411.352) for the provision of items or services (other than the rental of office space) by the physician (or an immediate family member) or group of physicians to the entity, or by the entity to the physician (or an immediate family member) or a group of physicians, if the arrangement meets the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(1) The arrangement is in writing, signed by the parties, and covers only identifiable items or services, all of which are specified in writing.</P>

        <P>(2) The writing specifies the timeframe for the arrangement, which can be for any period of time and contain a termination clause, provided that the parties enter into only one arrangement for the same items or services during the course of a year. An arrangement may be renewed any number of times if the terms of the arrangement and the compensation for <PRTPAGE P="538"/>the same items or services do not change.</P>
        <P>(3) The writing specifies the compensation that will be provided under the arrangement. The compensation must be set in advance, consistent with fair market value, and not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician. Compensation for the rental of equipment may not be determined using a formula based on—</P>
        <P>(i) A percentage of the revenue raised, earned, billed, collected, or otherwise attributable to the services performed or business generated through the use of the equipment; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Per-unit of service rental charges, to the extent that such charges reflect services provided to patients referred by the lessor to the lessee.</P>
        <P>(4) The arrangement is commercially reasonable (taking into account the nature and scope of the transaction) and furthers the legitimate business purposes of the parties.</P>
        <P>(5) The arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>

        <P>(1) The compensation is offered to all members of the medical staff practicing in the same specialty (but not necessarily accepted by every member to whom it is offered) and is not offered in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between the parties.</P>
        <P>(2) Except with respect to identification of medical staff on a hospital Web site or in hospital advertising, the compensation is provided only during periods when the medical staff members are making rounds or are engaged in other services or activities that benefit the hospital or its patients.</P>

        <P>(7) The compensation arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>

        <P>(8) Other facilities and health care clinics (including, but not limited to, federally qualified health centers) that <PRTPAGE P="539"/>have <E T="03">bona fide</E> medical staffs may provide compensation under this paragraph (m) on the same terms and conditions applied to hospitals under this paragraph (m).</P>
        <P>(n) <E T="03">Risk-sharing arrangements.</E> Compensation pursuant to a risk-sharing arrangement (including, but not limited to, withholds, bonuses, and risk pools) between a MCO or an IPA and a physician (either directly or indirectly through a subcontractor) for services provided to enrollees of a health plan, provided that the arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.

For purposes of this paragraph (o), “compliance training” means training regarding the basic elements of a compliance program (for example, establishing policies and procedures, training of staff, internal monitoring, or reporting); specific training regarding the requirements of Federal and State health care programs (for example, billing, coding, reasonable and necessary services, documentation, or unlawful referral arrangements); or training regarding other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or rules governing the conduct of the party for whom the training is provided. For purposes of this paragraph, “compliance training” includes programs that offer continuing medical education credit, provided that compliance training is the primary purpose of the program.</P>

        <P>(A) A percentage of the revenue raised, earned, billed, collected, or otherwise attributable to the services performed or business generated in the office space or to the services performed on or business generated through the use of the equipment; or</P>
        <P>(B) Per-unit of service rental charges, to the extent that such charges reflect services provided to patients referred by the lessor to the lessee.</P>

        <P>(3) The compensation arrangement does not violate the anti-kickback statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or any Federal or State law or regulation governing billing or claims submission.</P>

For purposes of this paragraph, the most recent 12-month period for which data are available means the most recent 12-month period for which the data source used contains all data from the requesting hospital and each hospital located in the same county as the requesting hospital.</P>
        <P>(A) Until such time that the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) contains sufficiently complete inpatient Medicaid discharge data, a hospital may use filed Medicare hospital cost report data or data from an external data source (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) to estimate its annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid and the average percent with respect to such admissions for all hospitals located in the county in which the hospital is located.</P>

CMS will provide on its Web site State average bed capacities and the national average bed capacity. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), “sufficient number” means the number of hospitals, as determined by CMS that <PRTPAGE P="551"/>would ensure that the determination under this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) would not materially change after additional hospital data are reported.</P>

        <P>(A) Until such time that the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) contains sufficiently complete inpatient Medicaid discharge data, a hospital may use filed Medicare hospital cost report data or data from an external data source (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) to estimate its annual percentage of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid and the annual percentages of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid for every other hospital located in the county in which the hospital is located.</P>
        <P>(B) On or after such date that the Secretary determines that HCRIS contains sufficiently complete inpatient Medicaid discharge data, a hospital may use only filed Medicare hospital cost report data to estimate its annual percentage of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid and the annual percentages of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid for every other hospital located in the county in which the hospital is located.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Advisory opinions relating to physician referrals.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Period during which CMS accepts requests.</E> The provisions of § 411.370 <PRTPAGE P="553"/>through § 411.389 apply to requests for advisory opinions that are submitted to CMS during any time period in which CMS is required by law to issue the advisory opinions described in this subpart.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Matters that qualify for advisory opinions and who may request one.</E> Any individual or entity may request a written advisory opinion from CMS concerning whether a physician's referral relating to designated health services (other than clinical laboratory services) is prohibited under section 1877 of the Act. In the advisory opinion, CMS determines whether a business arrangement described by the parties to that arrangement appears to constitute a “financial relationship” (as defined in section 1877(a)(2) of the Act) that could potentially restrict a physician's referrals, and whether the arrangement or the designated health services at issue appear to qualify for any of the exceptions to the referral prohibition described in section 1877 of the Act.</P>
        <P>(1) The request must involve an existing arrangement or one into which the requestor, in good faith, specifically plans to enter. The planned arrangement may be contingent upon the party or parties receiving a favorable advisory opinion. CMS does not consider, for purposes of an advisory opinion, requests that present a general question of interpretation, pose a hypothetical situation, or involve the activities of third parties.</P>
        <P>(2) The requestor must be a party to the existing or proposed arrangement.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Matters not subject to advisory opinions.</E> CMS does not address through the advisory opinion process—</P>
        <P>(1) Whether the fair market value was, or will be, paid or received for any goods, services, or property; and</P>
        <P>(2) Whether an individual is a <E T="03">bona fide</E> employee within the requirements of section 3121(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Facts subject to advisory opinions.</E> CMS considers requests for advisory opinions that involve applying specific facts to the subject matter described in paragraph (b) of this section. Requestors must include in the advisory opinion request a complete description of the arrangement that the requestor is undertaking, or plans to undertake, as described in § 411.372.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Requests that will not be accepted.</E> CMS does not accept an advisory opinion request or issue an advisory opinion if—</P>
        <P>(1) The request is not related to a named individual or entity;</P>
        <P>(2) CMS is aware that the same, or substantially the same, course of action is under investigation, or is or has been the subject of a proceeding involving the Department of Health and Human Services or another governmental agency; or</P>
        <P>(3) CMS believes that it cannot make an informed opinion or could only make an informed opinion after extensive investigation, clinical study, testing, or collateral inquiry.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Effects of an advisory opinion on other Governmental authority.</E> Nothing in this part limits the investigatory or prosecutorial authority of the OIG, the Department of Justice, or any other agency of the Government. In addition, in connection with any request for an advisory opinion, CMS, the OIG, or the Department of Justice may conduct whatever independent investigation it believes appropriate.</P>

        </P>
        <P>(i) A complete description of the arrangement that the requestor is undertaking, or plans to undertake, including: the purpose of the arrangement; the nature of each party's (including each entity's) contribution to the arrangement; the direct or indirect relationships between the parties, with an emphasis on the relationships between physicians involved in the arrangement (or their immediate family members who are involved) and any entities that provide designated health services; the types of services for which a physician wishes to refer, and whether the referrals will involve Medicare or Medicaid patients;</P>
        <P>(ii) Complete copies of all relevant documents or relevant portions of documents that affect or could affect the arrangement, such as personal services or employment contracts, leases, deeds, pension or insurance plans, financial statements, or stock certificates (or, if these relevant documents do not yet exist, a complete description, to the best of the requestor's knowledge, of what these documents are likely to contain);</P>
        <P>(iii) Detailed statements of all collateral or oral understandings, if any; and</P>
        <P>(iv) Descriptions of any other arrangements or relationships that could affect CMS's analysis.</P>

The requestor must also include a brief description of any other entities that could affect the outcome of the opinion, including those with which the requestor, the other parties, or the immediate family members of involved physicians, have any financial relationships (either direct or indirect, and as defined in section 1877(a)(2) of the Act and § 411.351), or in which any of the parties holds an ownership or control interest as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(6) A discussion of the specific issues or questions the requestor would like CMS to address including, if possible, a description of why the requestor believes the referral prohibition in section 1877 of the Act might or might not be triggered by the arrangement and which, if any, exceptions to the prohibition the requestor believes might apply. The requestor should attempt to designate which facts are relevant to each issue or question raised in the request and should cite the provisions of law under which each issue or question arises.</P>
        <P>(7) An indication of whether the parties involved in the request have also asked for or are planning to ask for an advisory opinion on the arrangement in question from the OIG under section 1128D(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7d(b)) and whether the arrangement is or is not, to the best of the requestor's knowledge, the subject of an investigation.</P>
        <P>(8) The certification(s) described in § 411.373. The certification(s) must be signed by—</P>
        <P>(i) The requestor, if the requestor is an individual;</P>

        <P>(9) A check or money order payable to CMS in the amount described in § 411.375(a).</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional information CMS might require.</E> If the request does not contain all of the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, or, if either before or after accepting the request, CMS believes it needs more information in order to render an advisory opinion, it may request whatever additional information or documents it deems necessary. Additional information must be provided in writing, signed by the same person who signed the initial request (or by an individual in a comparable position), and be certified as described in § 411.373.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Fees for the cost of advisory opinions.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial payment.</E> Parties must include with each request for an advisory opinion submitted through December 31, 1998, a check or money order payable to CMS for $250. For requests submitted after this date, parties must include a check or money order in this amount, unless CMS has revised the amount of the initial fee in a program issuance, in which case, the requestor must include the revised amount. This initial payment is nonrefundable.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">How costs are calculated.</E> Before issuing the advisory opinion, CMS calculates the costs the Department has incurred in responding to the request. The calculation includes the costs of salaries, benefits, and overhead for analysts, attorneys, and others who have worked on the request, as well as administrative and supervisory support for these individuals.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreement to pay all costs.</E> (1) By submitting the request for an advisory opinion, the requestor agrees, except as indicated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, to pay all costs the Department incurs in responding to the request for an advisory opinion.</P>
        <P>(2) In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may designate a triggering dollar amount. If CMS estimates that the costs of processing the advisory opinion request have reached or are likely to exceed the designated triggering dollar amount, CMS notifies the requestor.</P>
        <P>(3) If CMS notifies the requestor that the actual or estimated cost of processing the request has reached or is likely to exceed the triggering dollar amount, CMS stops processing the request until the requestor makes a written request for CMS to continue. If CMS is delayed in processing the request for an advisory opinion because of this procedure, the time within which CMS must issue an advisory opinion is suspended until the requestor asks CMS to continue working on the request.</P>
        <P>(4) If the requestor chooses not to pay for CMS to complete an advisory opinion, or withdraws the request, the requestor is still obligated to pay for all costs CMS has identified as costs it incurred in processing the request for an advisory opinion, up to that point.</P>
        <P>(5) If the costs CMS has incurred in responding to the request are greater than the amount the requestor has paid, CMS, before issuing the advisory opinion, notifies the requestor of any additional amount that is due. CMS does not issue an advisory opinion until the requestor has paid the full amount that is owed. Once the requestor has paid CMS the total amount due for the costs of processing the request, CMS issues the advisory opinion. The time period CMS has for issuing advisory opinions is suspended from the time CMS notifies the requestor of the amount owed until the time CMS receives full payment.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees for outside experts.</E> (1) In addition to the fees identified in this section, the requestor also must pay any required fees for expert opinions, if any, from outside sources, as described in § 411.377.</P>

        <P>(2) The time period for issuing an advisory opinion is suspended from the time that CMS notifies the requestor that it needs an outside expert opinion <PRTPAGE P="556"/>until the time CMS receives that opinion.</P>

        <P>(a) CMS may request expert advice from qualified sources if CMS believes that the advice is necessary to respond to a request for an advisory opinion. For example, CMS may require the use of accountants or business experts to assess the structure of a complex business arrangement or to ascertain a physician's or immediate family member's financial relationship with entities that provide designated health services.</P>
        <P>(b) If CMS determines that it needs to obtain expert advice in order to issue a requested advisory opinion, CMS notifies the requestor of that fact and provides the identity of the appropriate expert and an estimate of the costs of the expert advice. As indicated in § 411.375(d), the requestor must pay the estimated cost of the expert advice.</P>
        <P>(c) Once CMS has received payment for the estimated cost of the expert advice, CMS arranges for the expert to provide a prompt review of the issue or issues in question. CMS considers any additional expenses for the expert advice, beyond the estimated amount, as part of the costs CMS has incurred in responding to the request, and the responsibility of the requestor, as described in § 411.375(c).</P>

This party must submit the withdrawal in writing to the same address as the request, as indicated in § 411.372(a). Even if the party withdraws the request, the party must pay the costs the Department has expended in processing the request, as discussed in § 411.375.

        <P>(b) An advisory opinion contains a description of the material facts known to CMS that relate to the arrangement that is the subject of the advisory opinion, and states CMS's opinion about the subject matter of the request based on those facts. If necessary, CMS includes in the advisory opinion material facts that could be considered confidential information or trade secrets within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1095.</P>

        <P>(c)(1) CMS issues an advisory opinion, in accordance with the provisions of this part, within 90 days after it has formally accepted the request for an advisory opinion, or, for requests that CMS determines, in its discretion, involve complex legal issues or highly <PRTPAGE P="557"/>complicated fact patterns, within a reasonable time period.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions for payment.</E> Notwithstanding the exclusions set forth in § 411.15 (g) and (k). Medicare pays for “custodial care” and “services not reasonable and necessary” if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(1) The services were funished by a provider or by a practitioner or supplier that had accepted assignment of benefits for those services.</P>
        <P>(2) Neither the beneficiary nor the provider, practitioner, or supplier knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the services were excluded from coverage under § 411.15 (g) or (k).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Time limits on payment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, payment may not be made for inpatient hospital care, posthospital SNF care, or home health services furnished after the earlier of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The day on which the beneficiary has been determined, under § 411.404, to have knowledge, actual or imputed, that the services were excluded from coverage by reason of § 411.15(g) or § 411.15(k).</P>
        <P>(ii) The day on which the provider has been determined, under § 411.406 to have knowledge, actual or imputed, that the services are excluded from coverage by reason of § 411.15(g) or § 411.15(k).</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Payment may be made for services furnished during the first day after the limit established in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the QIO or the intermediary determines that the additional period of one day is necessary for planning post-discharge care. It the QIO or the intermediary determines that yet another day is necessary for planning post-discharge care, payment may be made for services furnished during the second day after the limit established in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Indemnification of beneficiary.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions for indemnification.</E> If Medicare payment is precluded because the conditions of § 411.400(a)(2) are not met. Medicare indemnifies the beneficiary (and recovers from the provider, practitioner, or supplier), if the following conditions are met:</P>
        <P>(1) The beneficiary paid the provider, practitioner, or supplier some or all of the charges for the excluded services.</P>

        <P>(2) The beneficiary did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the services were not covered.<PRTPAGE P="559"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) The provider, practitioner, or supplier knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know that the services were not covered.</P>
        <P>(4) The beneficiary files a proper request for indemnification before the end of the sixth month after whichever of the following is later:</P>
        <P>(i) The month is which the beneficiary paid the provider, practitioner, or supplier.</P>
        <P>(ii) The month in which the intermediary or carrier notified the beneficiary (or someone on his or her behalf) that the beneficiary would not be liable for the services.</P>
        <FP>For good cause shown by the beneficiary, the 6-month period may be extended.</FP>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of indemnification.</E> <SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/> The amount of indemnification is the total that the beneficiary paid the provider, practitioner, or supplier.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU> For services furnished before 1988, the indemnification amount was reduced by any deductible or coinsurance amounts that would have been applied if the services had been covered.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of indemnification.</E> The amount of indemnification is considered an overpayment to the provider, practitioner, or supplier, and as such is recoverable under this part or in accordance with other applicable provisions of law.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Criteria for determining that a beneficiary knew that services were excluded from coverage as custodial care or as not reasonable and necessary.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> A beneficiary who receives services that constitute custodial care under § 411.15(g) or that are not reasonable and necessary under § 411.15(k), is considered to have known that the services were not covered if the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Written notice.</E> (1) Written notice is given to the beneficiary, or to someone acting on his or her behalf, that the services were not covered because they did not meet Medicare coverage guidelines.</P>
        <P>(2) A notice concerning similar or reasonably comparable services furnished on a previous occasion also meets this criterion.</P>
        <P>(3) After a beneficiary is notified that there is no Medicare payment for a service that is not covered by Medicare, he or she is presumed to know that there is no Medicare payment for any form of subsequent treatment for the non-covered condition.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Source of notice.</E> The notice was given by one of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The QIO, intermediary, or carrier.</P>
        <P>(2) The group or committee responsible for utilization review for the provider that furnished the services.</P>
        <P>(3) The provider, practitioner, or supplier that furnished the service.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> A provider, practitioner, or supplier that furnished services which constitute custodial care under § 411.15(g) or that are not reasonable and necessary under § 411.15(k) is considered to have known that the services were not covered if any one of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section is met.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice from the QIO, intermediary or carrier.</E> The QIO, intermediary, or carrier had informed the provider, practitioner, or supplier that the services furnished were not covered, or that similar or reasonably comparable services were not covered.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice from the utilization review committee or the beneficiary's attending phyician.</E> The utilization review group or committee for the provider or the beneficiary's attending physician had informed the provider that these services were not covered.</P>

        <P>(e) <E T="03">Knowledge based on experience, actual notice, or constructive notice.</E> It is clear that the provider, practitioner, or supplier could have been expected to <PRTPAGE P="560"/>have known that the services were excluded from coverage on the basis of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Its receipt of CMS notices, including manual issuances, bulletins, or other written guides or directives from intermediaries, carriers, or QIOs, including notification of QIO screening criteria specific to the condition of the beneficiary for whom the furnished services are at issue and of medical procedures subject to preadmission review by a QIO.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Refunds of amounts collected for physician services not reasonable and necessary, payment not accepted on an assignment-related basis.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a physician who furnishes a beneficiary services for which the physician does not undertake to claim payment on an assignment-related basis must refund any amounts collected from the beneficiary for services otherwise covered if Medicare payment is denied because the services are found to be not reasonable and necessary under § 411.15(k).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Time limits for making refunds.</E> A timely refund of any incorrectly collected amounts of money must be made to the beneficiary to whom the services were furnished. A refund is timely if—</P>
        <P>(1) A physician who does not request a review within 30 days after receipt of the denial notice makes the refund within that time period; or</P>
        <P>(2) A physician who files a request for review within 30 days after receipt of the denial notice makes the refund within 15 days after receiving notice of an initial adverse review determination, whether or not the physician further appeals the initial adverse review determination.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Notices and appeals.</E> If payment is denied for nonassignment-related claims because the services are found to be not reasonable and necessary, a notice of denial will be sent to both the physician and the beneficiary. The physician who does not accept assignment will have the same rights as a physician who submits claims on an assignment-related basis, as detailed in subpart H of part 405 and subpart B of part 473, to appeal the determination, and will be subject to the same time limitations.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">When a refund is not required.</E> A refund of any amounts collected for services not reasonable and necessary is not required if—</P>
        <P>(1) The physician did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that Medicare would not pay for the service; or</P>
        <P>(2) Before the service was provided—</P>
        <P>(i) The physician informed the beneficiary, or someone acting on the beneficiary's behalf, in writing that the physician believed Medicare was likely to deny payment for the specific service; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The beneficiary (or someone eligible to sign for the beneficiary under § 424.36(b) of this chapter) signed a statement agreeing to pay for that service.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Criteria for determining that a physician knew that services were excluded as not reasonable and necessary.</E> A physician will be determined to have known that furnished services were excluded from coverage as not reasonable and necessary if one or more of the conditions in § 411.406 of this subpart are met.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Acceptable evidence of prior notice to a beneficiary that Medicare was likely to deny payment for a particular service.</E> To qualify for waiver of the refund requirement under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the physician must inform the beneficiary (or person acting on his or her behalf) that the physician believes Medicare is likely to deny payment.</P>

        <P>(i) Be in writing, using approved notice language;</P>

        <P>(ii) Cite the particular service or services for which payment is likely to be denied; and<PRTPAGE P="561"/>
        </P>
        <P>(iii) Cite the physician's reasons for believing Medicare payment will be denied.</P>
        <P>(2) The notice is not acceptable evidence if—</P>
        <P>(i) The physician routinely gives this notice to all beneficiaries for whom he or she furnishes services; or</P>
        <P>(ii) The notice is no more than a statement to the effect that there is a possibility that Medicare may not pay for the service.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Applicability of sanctions to physicians who fail to make refunds under this section.</E> A physician who knowingly and willfully fails to make refunds as required by this section may be subject to sanctions as provided for in chapter V, parts 1001, 1002, and 1003 of this title.</P>
