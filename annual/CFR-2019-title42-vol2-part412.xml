        <SECTNO>§ 412.1</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Scope of part.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) This part implements sections 1886(d) and (g) of the Act by establishing a prospective payment system for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and a prospective payment system for the capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services furnished to <PRTPAGE P="565"/>Medicare beneficiaries in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991. Under these prospective payment systems, payment for the operating and capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to the systems (generally, short-term, acute-care hospitals) is made on the basis of prospectively determined rates and applied on a per discharge basis. Payment for other costs related to inpatient hospital services (organ acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved organ transplantation centers, the costs of qualified nonphysician anesthetist's services, as described in § 412.113(c), and direct costs of approved nursing and allied health educational programs) is made on a reasonable cost basis. Payment for the direct costs of graduate medical education is made on a per resident amount basis in accordance with §§ 413.75-413.83 of this chapter. Additional payments are made for outlier cases, bad debts, indirect medical education costs, and for serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Under either prospective payment system, a hospital may keep the difference between its prospective payment rate and its operating or capital-related costs incurred in furnishing inpatient services, and the hospital is at risk for inpatient operating or inpatient capital-related costs that exceed its payment rate.</P>
        <P>(2) This part implements section 124 of Public Law 106-113 by establishing a per diem prospective payment system for the inpatient operating and capital costs of hospital inpatient services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries by a psychiatric facility that meets the conditions of subpart N of this part.</P>
        <P>(3) This part implements section 1886(j) of the Act by establishing a prospective payment system for the inpatient operating and capital costs of inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries by a rehabilitation hospital or rehabilitation unit that meets the conditions of § 412.604.</P>
        <P>(4) This part implements the following regarding long-term care hospitals—</P>
        <P>(i) Section 123 of Public Law 106-113, which provides for the establishment of a prospective payment system for the costs of inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries by long-term care hospitals described in section 1886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002.</P>
        <P>(ii) The provisions of section 307(b) of Public Law 106-554, which state that the Secretary shall examine and may provide for appropriate adjustments to the long-term care hospital prospective payment system, including adjustments to diagnosis-related group (DRG) weights, area wage adjustments, geographic reclassification, outlier adjustments, updates, and disproportionate share adjustments consistent with section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(iii) Section 114 of Public Law 110-173, which contains several provisions regarding long-term care hospitals, including the—</P>
        <P>(A) Amendment of section 1886 of the Act to add a new subsection (m) that references section 123 of Public Law 106-113 and section 307(b) of Public Law 106-554 for the establishment and implementation of a prospective payment system for payments under title XVIII for inpatient hospital services furnished by a long-term care hospital described in section 1886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(B) Revision of the standard Federal rate for RY 2008.</P>
        <P>(5) This part implements section 1886(q) of the Act, which provides that, effective for discharges from an “applicable hospital” beginning on or after October 1, 2012, payments to those hospitals under section 1886(d) of the Act will be reduced to account for certain excess readmissions, under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. This reduction will be made through an adjustment to the hospital's base operating DRG payment amounts under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs.</P>

        <P>(6) This part implements section 1886(o)(1)(B) of the Act, which directs the Secretary to begin to make value-based incentive payments under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program to hospitals for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012, through an adjustment to the base operating <PRTPAGE P="566"/>DRG payment amounts under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs.</P>

      <SECTION>
        <SECTNO>§ 412.2</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Basis of payment.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment on a per discharge basis.</E> Under both the inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related prospective payment systems, hospitals are paid a predetermined amount per discharge <PRTPAGE P="567"/>for inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. The prospective payment rate for each discharge (as defined in § 412.4) is determined according to the methodology described in subpart D, E, or G of this part, as appropriate, for operating costs, and according to the methodology described in subpart M of this part for capital-related costs. An additional payment is made for both inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related costs, in accordance with subpart F of this part, for cases that are extraordinarily costly to treat.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment in full.</E> (1) The prospective payment amount paid for inpatient hospital services is the total Medicare payment for the inpatient operating costs (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) and the inpatient capital-related costs (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) incurred in furnishing services covered by the Medicare program.</P>
        <P>(2) The full prospective payment amount, as determined under subpart D, E, or G and under subpart M of this part, is made for each stay during which there is at least one Medicare payable day of care. Payable days of care, for purposes of this paragraph include the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Limitation of liability days payable under the payment procedures for custodial care and services that are not reasonable and necessary as specified in § 411.400 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) Guarantee of payment days, as authorized under § 409.68 of this chapter, for inpatient hospital services furnished to an individual whom the hospital has reason to believe is entitled to Medicare benefits at the time of admission.</P>
        <P>(3) If a patient is admitted to an acute care hospital and then the acute care hospital meets the criteria at § 412.23(e) to be paid as a LTCH, during the course of the patient's hospitalization, Medicare considers all the days of the patient stay in the facility (days prior to and after the designation of LTCH status) to be a single episode of LTCH care. Medicare will not make payment under subpart H for any part of the hospitalization. Payment for the entire patient stay (days prior to and after the designation of LTCH status) will be made in accordance with the requirements specified in § 412.521. The requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) apply only to a patient stay in which a patient is in an acute care hospital and that hospital is designated as a LTCH on or after October 1, 2004.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Inpatient operating costs.</E> The prospective payment system provides a payment amount for inpatient operating costs, including—</P>
        <P>(1) Operating costs for routine services (as described in § 413.53(b) of this chapter), such as the costs of room, board, and routine nursing services;</P>
        <P>(2) Operating costs for ancillary services, such as radiology and laboratory services furnished to hospital inpatients;</P>
        <P>(3) Special care unit operating costs (intensive care type unit services, as described in § 413.53(b) of this chapter);</P>
        <P>(4) Malpractice insurance costs related to services furnished to inpatients; and</P>
        <P>(5) Preadmission services otherwise payable under Medicare Part B furnished to a beneficiary on the date of the beneficiary's admission to the hospital and during the 3 calendar days immediately preceding the date of the beneficiary's admission to the hospital that meet the condition specified in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section and at least one of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) through (c)(5)(iv).</P>
        <P>(i) The services are furnished by the hospital or by an entity wholly owned or operated by the hospital. An entity is wholly owned by the hospital if the hospital is the sole owner of the entity. An entity is wholly operated by a hospital if the hospital has exclusive responsibility for conducting and overseeing the entity's routine operations, regardless of whether the hospital also has policymaking authority over the entity.</P>
        <P>(ii) For services furnished after January 1, 1991, the services are diagnostic (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests).</P>

        <P>(iii) For services furnished on or after October 1, 1991, through June 24, 2010, the services are furnished in connection with the principal diagnosis that requires the beneficiary to be admitted <PRTPAGE P="568"/>as an inpatient and are not the following:</P>
        <P>(A) Ambulance services.</P>
        <P>(B) Maintenance renal dialysis.</P>
        <P>(iv) Nondiagnostic services furnished on or after June 25, 2010, other than ambulance services and maintenance renal dialysis services, that are furnished on the date of the beneficiary's inpatient admission or on the first, second, or third calendar day immediately preceding the date of the beneficiary's inpatient admission and the hospital does not attest that such services are unrelated to the beneficiary's inpatient admission.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Inpatient capital-related costs.</E> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the capital prospective payment system provides a payment amount for inpatient hospital capital-related costs as described in part 413, subpart G of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Excluded costs.</E> The following inpatient hospital costs are excluded from the prospective payment amounts and are paid for on a reasonable cost basis:</P>
        <P>(1) Capital-related costs for cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991, and an allowance for return on equity, as described in §§ 413.130 and 413.157, respectively, of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) Direct medical education costs for approved nursing and allied health education programs as described in § 413.85 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(3) Costs for direct medical and surgical services of physicians in teaching hospitals exercising the election in § 405.521 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(4) The acquisition costs of hearts, kidneys, livers, lungs, pancreas, and intestines (or multivisceral organs) incurred by approved transplantation centers.</P>
        <P>(5) The costs of qualified nonphysician anesthetists' services, as described in § 412.113(c).</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional payments to hospitals.</E> In addition to payments based on the prospective payment system rates for inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related costs, hospitals receive payments for the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Outlier cases, as described in subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(2) The indirect costs of graduate medical education, as specified in subparts F and G of this part and in § 412.105 for inpatient operating costs and in § 412.322 for inpatient capital-related costs.</P>
        <P>(3) Costs excluded from the prospective payment rates under paragraph (e) of this section, as provided in § 412.115.</P>
        <P>(4) Bad debts of Medicare beneficiaries, as provided in § 412.115(a).</P>
        <P>(5) ESRD beneficiary discharges if such discharges are ten percent or more of the hospital's total Medicare discharges, as provided in § 412.104.</P>
        <P>(6) Serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients, as provided in § 412.106 for inpatient operating costs and § 412.320 for inpatient capital-related costs.</P>
        <P>(7) The direct graduate medical education costs for approved residency programs in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, and podiatry as described in §§ 413.75-413.83 of this chapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Admissions.</SUBJECT>

        <P>(a) For purposes of payment under Medicare Part A, an individual is considered an inpatient of a hospital, including a critical access hospital, if formally admitted as an inpatient pursuant to an order for inpatient admission by a physician or other qualified practitioner in accordance with this section and §§ 482.24(c), 482.12(c), and <PRTPAGE P="569"/>485.638(a)(4)(iii) of this chapter for a critical access hospital. In addition, inpatient rehabilitation facilities also must adhere to the admission requirements specified in § 412.622.</P>
        <P>(b) The order must be furnished by a qualified and licensed practitioner who has admitting privileges at the hospital as permitted by State law, and who is knowledgeable about the patient's hospital course, medical plan of care, and current condition. The practitioner may not delegate the decision (order) to another individual who is not authorized by the State to admit patients, or has not been granted admitting privileges applicable to that patient by the hospital's medical staff.</P>
        <P>(c) The physician order must be furnished at or before the time of the inpatient admission.</P>
        <P>(d)(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, an inpatient admission is generally appropriate for payment under Medicare Part A when the admitting physician expects the patient to require hospital care that crosses two midnights.</P>
        <P>(i) The expectation of the physician should be based on such complex medical factors as patient history and comorbidities, the severity of signs and symptoms, current medical needs, and the risk of an adverse event. The factors that lead to a particular clinical expectation must be documented in the medical record in order to be granted consideration.</P>
        <P>(ii) If an unforeseen circumstance, such as a beneficiary's death or transfer, results in a shorter beneficiary stay than the physician's expectation of at least 2 midnights, the patient may be considered to be appropriately treated on an inpatient basis, and payment for an inpatient hospital stay may be made under Medicare Part A.</P>
        <P>(2) An inpatient admission for a surgical procedure specified by Medicare as inpatient only under § 419.22(n) of this chapter is generally appropriate for payment under Medicare Part A, regardless of the expected duration of care.</P>
        <P>(3) Where the admitting physician expects a patient to require hospital care for only a limited period of time that does not cross 2 midnights, an inpatient admission may be appropriate for payment under Medicare Part A based on the clinical judgment of the admitting physician and medical record support for that determination. The physician's decision should be based on such complex medical factors as patient history and comorbidities, the severity of signs and symptoms, current medical needs, and the risk of an adverse event. In these cases, the factors that lead to the decision to admit the patient as an inpatient must be supported by the medical record in order to be granted consideration.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Discharges and transfers.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Discharges.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a hospital inpatient is considered discharged from a hospital paid under the prospective payment system when—</P>
        <P>(1) The patient is formally released from the hospital; or</P>
        <P>(2) The patient dies in the hospital.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Acute care transfers.</E> A discharge of a hospital inpatient is considered to be a transfer for purposes of payment under this part if the patient is readmitted the same day (unless the readmission is unrelated to the initial discharge) to another hospital that is—</P>
        <P>(1) Paid under the prospective payment system described in subparts A through M of this part;</P>
        <P>(2) Excluded from being paid under the prospective payment system described in subparts A through M of this part because of participation in an approved statewide cost control program as described in subpart C of part 403 of this chapter;</P>
        <P>(3) An acute care hospital that would otherwise be eligible to be paid under the IPPS, but does not have an agreement to participate in the Medicare program; or</P>
        <P>(4) A critical access hospital.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Postacute care transfers.</E> A discharge of a hospital inpatient is considered to be a transfer for purposes of this part when the patient's discharge is assigned, as described in § 412.60(c), <PRTPAGE P="570"/>to one of the qualifying diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) listed in paragraph (d) of this section and the discharge is made under any of the following circumstances:</P>

        <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifying DRGs.</E> (1) For a fiscal year prior to FY 2006, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the qualifying DRGs must meet the following criteria for both of the 2 most recent years for which data are available:</P>
        <P>(i) The DRG must have a geometric mean length of stay of at least 3 days.</P>
        <P>(ii) The DRG must have at least 14,000 cases identified as postacute care transfer cases.</P>
        <P>(iii) The DRG must have at least 10 percent of the postacute care transfers occurring before the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG.</P>
        <P>(iv) If the DRG is one of a paired DRG based on the presence or absence of a comorbidity or complication, one of the DRGs meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(v) To initially qualify, the DRG must meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section and must have a decline in the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG during the most recent 5 years of at least 7 percent. Once a DRG initially qualifies, the DRG is subject to the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section for each subsequent fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (c), a discharge is also considered to be a transfer if it meets the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(i) The discharge is assigned to a DRG that contains only cases that were assigned to a DRG that qualified under this paragraph within the previous 2 years; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The latter DRG was split or otherwise modified within the previous 2 fiscal years.</P>
        <P>(3) For fiscal years beginning with FY 2006, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section—</P>
        <P>(i) The qualifying DRGs must meet the following criteria using data from the March 2005 update of the FY 2004 MedPAR file and Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual (FY 2006):</P>

        <P>(B) At least 5.5 percent of the cases in the DRG are discharged to postacute care prior to the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG;</P>
        <P>(C) The DRG must have a geometric mean length of stay greater than 3 days;</P>
        <P>(D) The DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence of a comorbidity or complication or major cardiovascular condition that, it meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) If a DRG did not exist in Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual or a DRG included in Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual is revised, the DRG will be a qualifying DRG if it meets the following criteria based on the version of the DRG Definitions Manual in use when the new or revised DRG first becomes effective, using the most recent complete year of MedPAR data:</P>
        <P>(A) The total number of discharges to postacute care in the DRG must equal or exceed the 55th percentile for all DRGs;</P>
        <P>(B) The proportion of short-stay discharges to postacute care to total discharges in the DRG exceeds the 55th percentile for all DRGs;</P>

        <P>(D) In the case of MS-DRGs that share the same base MS-DRG, if one MS-DRG meets the criteria specified <PRTPAGE P="571"/>under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, every MS-DRG that shares the same base MS-DRG is a qualifying DRG.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment for discharges.</E> The hospital discharging an inpatient (under paragraph (a) of this section) is paid in full, in accordance with § 412.2(b).</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Payment for transfers</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section, a hospital that transfers an inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, is paid a graduated per diem rate for each day of the patient's stay in that hospital, not to exceed the amount that would have been paid under subparts D and M of this part if the patient had been discharged to another setting. The per diem rate is determined by dividing the appropriate prospective payment rate (as determined under subparts D and M of this part) by the geometric mean length of stay for the specific DRG to which the case is assigned. Payment is graduated by paying twice the per diem amount for the first day of the stay, and the per diem amount for each subsequent day, up to the full DRG payment.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rule for DRGs 209, 210, and 211 for fiscal years prior to FY 2006.</E> For fiscal years prior to FY 2006, a hospital that transfers an inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section and the transfer is assigned to DRGs 209, 210, or 211 is paid as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) 50 percent of the appropriate prospective payment rate (as determined under subparts D and M of this part) for the first day of the stay; and</P>
        <P>(ii) 50 percent of the amount calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for each day of the stay, up to the full DRG payment.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Transfer assigned to DRG for newborns that die or are transferred to another hospital.</E> If a transfer is classified into CMS DRG 385 (Neonates, Died or Transferred) prior to October 1, 2007, or into MS-DRG 789 (Neonates, Died or Transferred to Another Acute Care Facility) on or after October 1, 2007, the transferring hospital is paid in accordance with § 412.2(b).</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Outliers.</E> Effective with discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1984, a transferring hospital may qualify for an additional payment for extraordinarily high-cost cases that meet the criteria for cost outliers as described in subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Special rule for DRGs meeting specific criteria.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, and prior to October 1, 2007, a hospital that transfers an inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section is paid using the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section if the transfer case is assigned to one of the DRGs meeting the following criteria:</P>

        <P>(iii) The geometric mean length of stay for the DRG is greater than 4 days; and</P>
        <P>(iv) If a DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence of a comorbidity or complication or a major cardiovascular complication that meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (f)(5)(i) through (f)(5)(iii) of this section, that DRG will also be paid under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Special rule for DRGs meeting specific criteria.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007, a hospital that transfers an inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section is paid using the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section if the transfer case is assigned to one of the DRGs meeting the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) The DRG meets the criteria specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(3)(ii) of this section;</P>

        <P>(i) <E T="03">Separate governing body.</E> The hospital has a governing body that is separate from the governing body of the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus. The hospital's governing body is not under the control of the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus, or of any third entity that controls both hospitals.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Separate chief medical officer.</E> The hospital has a single chief medical officer who reports directly to the governing body and who is responsible for all medical staff activities of the hospital. The chief medical officer of the hospital is not employed by or under contract with either the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus or any third entity that controls both hospitals.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Separate medical staff.</E> The hospital has a medical staff that is separate from the medical staff of the hospital occupying space in the same building or on the same campus.

        <P>(v) <E T="03">Performance of basic hospital functions.</E> Prior to October 1, 2017, the hospital meets one of the following criteria:</P>

        <P>(1) Continues to operate under the same terms and conditions, including the number of beds and square footage considered to be part of the hospital for purposes of Medicare participation and payment in effect on September 30, 1995; or</P>
        <P>(2) In the case of a hospital that changes the terms and conditions under which it operates after September 30, 1995, but before October 1, 2003, continues to operate under the same terms and conditions, including the number of beds and square footage considered to be part of the hospital for purposes of Medicare participation and payment in effect on September 30, 2003.</P>

        <P>(i) If a hospital to which the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies decreases its number of beds below the number of beds considered to be part of the hospital on September 30, 1995, it may subsequently increase the number of beds at any time as long as the resulting total number of beds considered to be part of the hospital does not exceed the number of beds at the hospital on September 30, 1995.</P>
        <P>(ii) If a hospital to which the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section applies decreases its number of beds below the number of beds considered to be part of the hospital on September 30, 2003, it may subsequently increase the number of beds at any time as long as the resulting total number of beds considered to be part of the hospital does not exceed the number of beds at the hospital on September 30, 2003.</P>

        <P>(ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after August 5, 1997 and on or before December 31, 2014, a hospital that was first excluded from the prospective payment system under this <PRTPAGE P="580"/>section in 1986 meets the length-of-stay criterion if it has an average inpatient length of stay for all patients, including both Medicare and non-Medicare inpatients, of greater than 20 days and demonstrates that at least 80 percent of its annual Medicare inpatient discharges in the 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1997 have a principal diagnosis that reflects a finding of neoplastic disease as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Calculation of average length of stay.</E> (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) through (vii) of this section, the average Medicare inpatient length of stay specified under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section is calculated by dividing the total number of covered and noncovered days of stay of Medicare inpatients (less leave or pass days) by the number of total Medicare discharges for the hospital's most recent complete cost reporting period. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) through (vii) of this section, the average inpatient length of stay specified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section is calculated by dividing the total number of days for all patients, including both Medicare and non-Medicare inpatients (less leave or pass days) by the number of total discharges for the hospital's most recent complete cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(ii) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2004, in calculating the hospital's average length of stay, if the days of a stay of an inpatient involves days of care furnished during two or more separate consecutive cost reporting periods, that is, an admission during one cost reporting period and a discharge during a future consecutive cost reporting period, the total number of days of the stay are considered to have occurred in the cost reporting period during which the inpatient was discharged. However, if after application of this provision, a hospital fails to meet the average length of stay specified under paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, Medicare will determine the hospital's average inpatient length of stay for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2004, but before July 1, 2005, by dividing the applicable total days for Medicare inpatients under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section or the total days for all inpatients under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, during the cost reporting period when they occur, by the number of discharges occurring during the same cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(iii) If a change in a hospital's average length of stay specified under paragraph (e)(2)(i) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section is indicated, the calculation is made by the same method for the period of at least 5 months of the immediately preceding 6-month period.</P>
        <P>(iv) If a hospital seeks exclusion from the inpatient prospective payment system as a long-term care hospital and a change of ownership (as described in § 489.18 of this chapter) occurs within the period of at least 5 months of the 6-month period preceding its petition for long-term care hospital status, the hospital may be excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system as a long-term care hospital for the next cost reporting period if, for the period of at least 5 months of the 6 months immediately preceding the start of the cost reporting period for which the hospital is seeking exclusion from the inpatient prospective payment system as a long-term care hospital (including time before the change of ownership), the hospital has met the required average length of stay, has continuously operated as a hospital, and has continuously participated as a hospital in Medicare.</P>

        <P>(v) For periods beginning on or after October 1, 2011, a hospital that is excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system as a long-term care hospital that plans to undergo a change of ownership (as described in § 489.18 of this chapter) must notify its fiscal intermediary or MAC within 30 days of the effective date of such change of ownership, as specified in § 424.516(e) of this subchapter. The hospital will continue to be excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system as a long-term care hospital for the cost reporting period following the change of ownership only if, for the period of at least 5 months of the 6 months immediately preceding the change of ownership, the hospital meets the required average length of <PRTPAGE P="581"/>stay (calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section).</P>
        <P>(vi) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, the Medicare inpatient days and discharges that are paid at the site neutral payment rate specified at § 412.522(c)(1) or paid under a Medicare Advantage plan (Medicare Part C) will not be included in the calculation of the Medicare inpatient average length of stay specified under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(vii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, the Medicare inpatient days and discharges that are associated with patients discharged from a unit of the hospital will not be included in the calculation of the Medicare inpatient average length of stay specified under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Excluded hospital units: Common requirements.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for exclusion.</E> In order to be excluded from the prospective payment systems as specified in § 412.1(a)(1) and be paid under the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system as specified in § 412.1(a)(2) or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system as specified in § 412.1(a)(3), a psychiatric or rehabilitation unit must meet the following requirements.</P>
        <P>(1) Be part of an institution that—</P>
        <P>(i) Has in effect an agreement under part 489 of this chapter to participate as a hospital;</P>
        <P>(ii) Prior to October 1, 2019, is not excluded in its entirety from the prospective payment systems; and</P>

        <P>(iii) Unless it is a unit in a critical access hospital, the hospital of which <PRTPAGE P="584"/>an IRF is a unit must have at least 10 staffed and maintained hospital beds that are paid under the applicable payment system under which the hospital is paid, or at least 1 staffed and maintained hospital bed for every 10 certified inpatient rehabilitation facility beds, whichever number is greater. Otherwise, the IRF will be classified as an IRF hospital, rather than an IRF unit. In the case of an inpatient psychiatric facility unit, the hospital must have enough beds that are paid under the applicable payment system under which the hospital is paid to permit the provision of adequate cost information, as required by § 413.24(c) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) Have written admission criteria that are applied uniformly to both Medicare and non-Medicare patients.</P>
        <P>(3) Have admission and discharge records that are separately identified from those of the hospital in which it is located and are readily available.</P>
        <P>(4) Have policies specifying that necessary clinical information is transferred to the unit when a patient of the hospital is transferred to the unit.</P>
        <P>(5) Meet applicable State licensure laws.</P>
        <P>(6) Have utilization review standards applicable for the type of care offered in the unit.</P>
        <P>(7) Have beds physically separate from (that is, not commingled with) the hospital's other beds.</P>
        <P>(8) Be serviced by the same fiscal intermediary as the hospital.</P>
        <P>(9) Be treated as a separate cost center for cost finding and apportionment purposes.</P>
        <P>(10) Use an accounting system that properly allocates costs.</P>
        <P>(11) Maintain adequate statistical data to support the basis of allocation.</P>
        <P>(12) Report its costs in the hospital's cost report covering the same fiscal period and using the same method of apportionment as the hospital.</P>
        <P>(13) As of the first day of the first cost reporting period for which all other exclusion requirements are met, the unit is fully equipped and staffed and is capable of providing hospital inpatient psychiatric or rehabilitation care regardless of whether there are any inpatients in the unit on that date.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Changes in the size of excluded units.</E> Except in the special cases noted at the end of this paragraph, changes in the number of beds or square footage considered to be part of an excluded unit under this section are allowed one time during a cost reporting period if the hospital notifies its Medicare contractor and the CMS RO in writing of the planned change at least 30 days before the date of the change. The hospital must maintain the information needed to accurately determine costs that are attributable to the excluded unit. A change in bed size or a change in square footage may occur at any time during a cost reporting period and must remain in effect for the rest of that cost reporting period. Changes in bed size or square footage may be made at any time if these changes are made necessary by relocation of a unit to permit construction or renovation necessary for compliance with changes in Federal, State, or local law affecting the physical facility or because of catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or tornadoes.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Changes in the status of hospital units.</E> For purposes of exclusions from the prospective payment systems under this section, the status of each hospital unit (excluded or not excluded) is determined as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) The status of a hospital unit may be changed from not excluded to excluded only at the start of the cost reporting period. If a unit is added to a hospital after the start of a cost reporting period, it cannot be excluded from the prospective payment systems before the start of a hospital's next cost reporting period.</P>

        <P>(2) The status of a hospital unit may be changed from excluded to not excluded at any time during a cost reporting period, but only if the hospital notifies the fiscal intermediary and the CMS Regional Office in writing of the change at least 30 days before the date of the change, and maintains the information needed to accurately determine costs that are or are not attributable to the excluded unit. A change in the status of a unit from excluded to not excluded that is made during a cost reporting period must remain in effect <PRTPAGE P="585"/>for the rest of that cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Number of excluded units.</E> Each hospital may have only one unit of each type (psychiatric or rehabilitation) excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1). A hospital excluded from the prospective payment systems as specified in § 412.1(a)(1) may not have an excluded unit (psychiatric or rehabilitation) that is excluded on the same basis as the hospital.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Satellite facilities.</E> (1) For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(5) of this section, a satellite facility is a part of a hospital unit that provides inpatient services in a building also used by another hospital, or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital.</P>
        <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(6) of this section, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1999, a hospital that has a satellite facility must meet the following criteria in order to be excluded from the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for any period:</P>
        <P>(i) In the case of a unit excluded from the prospective payment systems for the most recent cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1997, the unit's number of State-licensed and Medicare-certified beds, including those at the satellite facility, does not exceed the unit's number of State-licensed and Medicare-certified beds on the last day of the unit's last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1997.</P>
        <P>(ii) The satellite facility independently complies with—</P>
        <P>(A) For a rehabilitation unit, the requirements under § 412.29 of this subpart; or</P>
        <P>(B) For a psychiatric unit, the requirements under § 412.27(a).</P>
        <P>(iii) The satellite facility meets all of the following requirements:</P>
        <P>(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, it is not under the control of the governing body or chief executive officer of the hospital in which it is located, and it furnishes inpatient care through the use of medical personnel who are not under the control of the medical staff or chief medical officer of the hospital in which it is located.</P>
        <P>(B) It maintains admission and discharge records that are separately identified from those of the hospital in which it is located and are readily available.</P>
        <P>(C) It has beds that are physically separate from (that is, not commingled with) the beds of the hospital in which it is located.</P>
        <P>(D) It is serviced by the same fiscal intermediary as the hospital unit of which it is a part.</P>
        <P>(E) It is treated as a separate cost center of the hospital unit of which it is a part.</P>
        <P>(F) For cost reporting and apportionment purposes, it uses an accounting system that properly allocates costs and maintains adequate statistical data to support the basis of allocation.</P>
        <P>(G) It reports its costs on the cost report of the hospital of which it is a part, covering the same fiscal period and using the same method of apportionment as the hospital of which it is a part.</P>
        <P>(iv) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section do not apply to a satellite facility of a unit that is part of a hospital excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1) that does not furnish services in a building also used by another hospital that is not excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1), or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital that is not excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1).</P>

        </P>
        <P>(4) In applying the provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, any unit structured as a satellite facility on September 30, 1999, may increase or decrease the square footage of the satellite facility or may decrease the number of beds in the satellite facility considered to be part of the satellite facility at any time, if these changes are made by the relocation of a facility—</P>
        <P>(i) To permit construction or renovation necessary for compliance with changes in Federal, State, or local law affecting the physical facility; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Because of catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, or tornadoes.</P>

        <P>(ii) If the unit structured as a satellite facility decreases its number of beds below the number of beds considered to be part of the satellite facility on September 30, 1999, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it may subsequently increase the number of beds at the beginning or a cost reporting period as long as the resulting total number of beds considered to be part of the satellite facility does not exceed the number of beds at the satellite facility on September 30, 1999.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 412.29</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Classification criteria for payment under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system.</SUBJECT>
        <P>To be excluded from the prospective payment systems described in § 412.1(a)(1) and to be paid under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(3), an inpatient rehabilitation hospital or an inpatient rehabilitation unit of a hospital (otherwise referred to as an IRF) must meet the following requirements:</P>
        <P>(a) Have (or be part of a hospital that has) a provider agreement under part 489 of this chapter to participate as a hospital.</P>
        <P>(b) Except in the case of a “new” IRF or “new” IRF beds, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, an IRF must show that, during its most recent, consecutive, and appropriate 12-month time period (as defined by CMS or the Medicare contractor), it served an inpatient population that meets the following criteria:</P>

        <P>(1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2004, and before July 1, 2005, the IRF served an inpatient population of whom at least 50 percent, and for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2005, the IRF served an inpatient population of whom at least 60 percent required intensive rehabilitation services for treatment of one or more of the conditions specified at paragraph (b)(2) of <PRTPAGE P="589"/>this section. A patient with a comorbidity, as defined at § 412.602 of this part, may be included in the inpatient population that counts toward the required applicable percentage if—</P>
        <P>(i) The patient is admitted for inpatient rehabilitation for a condition that is not one of the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
        <P>(ii) The patient has a comorbidity that falls in one of the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(iii) The comorbidity has caused significant decline in functional ability in the individual that, even in the absence of the admitting condition, the individual would require the intensive rehabilitation treatment that is unique to inpatient rehabilitation facilities paid under subpart P of this part and that cannot be appropriately performed in another care setting covered under this title.</P>
        <P>(2) List of conditions.</P>
        <P>(i) Stroke.</P>
        <P>(ii) Spinal cord injury.</P>
        <P>(iii) Congenital deformity.</P>
        <P>(iv) Amputation.</P>
        <P>(v) Major multiple trauma.</P>
        <P>(vi) Fracture of femur (hip fracture).</P>
        <P>(vii) Brain injury.</P>
        <P>(viii) Neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, polyneuropathy, muscular dystrophy, and Parkinson's disease.</P>
        <P>(ix) Burns.</P>
        <P>(x) Active, polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and seronegative arthropathies resulting in significant functional impairment of ambulation and other activities of daily living that have not improved after an appropriate, aggressive, and sustained course of outpatient therapy services or services in other less intensive rehabilitation settings immediately preceding the inpatient rehabilitation admission or that result from a systemic disease activation immediately before admission, but have the potential to improve with more intensive rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>(xi) Systemic vasculidities with joint inflammation, resulting in significant functional impairment of ambulation and other activities of daily living that have not improved after an appropriate, aggressive, and sustained course of outpatient therapy services or services in other less intensive rehabilitation settings immediately preceding the inpatient rehabilitation admission or that result from a systemic disease activation immediately before admission, but have the potential to improve with more intensive rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>(xii) Severe or advanced osteoarthritis (osteoarthrosis or degenerative joint disease) involving two or more major weight bearing joints (elbow, shoulders, hips, or knees, but not counting a joint with a prosthesis) with joint deformity and substantial loss of range of motion, atrophy of muscles surrounding the joint, significant functional impairment of ambulation and other activities of daily living that have not improved after the patient has participated in an appropriate, aggressive, and sustained course of outpatient therapy services or services in other less intensive rehabilitation settings immediately preceding the inpatient rehabilitation admission but have the potential to improve with more intensive rehabilitation. (A joint replaced by a prosthesis no longer is considered to have osteoarthritis, or other arthritis, even though this condition was the reason for the joint replacement.)</P>
        <P>(xiii) Knee or hip joint replacement, or both, during an acute hospitalization immediately preceding the inpatient rehabilitation stay and also meet one or more of the following specific criteria:</P>
        <P>(A) The patient underwent bilateral knee or bilateral hip joint replacement surgery during the acute hospital admission immediately preceding the IRF admission.</P>
        <P>(B) The patient is extremely obese with a Body Mass Index of at least 50 at the time of admission to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(C) The patient is age 85 or older at the time of admission to the IRF.</P>

        <P>(c) In the case of new IRFs (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) or new IRF beds (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)of this section), the IRF must provide a written certification that the inpatient population it intends to serve meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. This written certification will apply until the end of the IRF's first full 12-month <PRTPAGE P="590"/>cost reporting period or, in the case of new IRF beds, until the end of the cost reporting period during which the new beds are added to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">New IRFs.</E> An IRF hospital or IRF unit is considered new if it has not been paid under the IRF PPS in subpart P of this part for at least 5 calendar years. A new IRF will be considered new from the point that it first participates in Medicare as an IRF until the end of its first full 12-month cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">New IRF beds.</E> Any IRF beds that are added to an existing IRF must meet all applicable State Certificate of Need and State licensure laws. New IRF beds may be added one time at any point during a cost reporting period and will be considered new for the rest of that cost reporting period. A full 12-month cost reporting period must elapse between the delicensing or decertification of IRF beds in an IRF hospital or IRF unit and the addition of new IRF beds to that IRF hospital or IRF unit. Before an IRF can add new beds, it must receive written approval from the appropriate CMS RO, so that the CMS RO can verify that a full 12-month cost reporting period has elapsed since the IRF has had beds delicensed or decertified. New IRF beds are included in the compliance review calculations under paragraph (b) of this section from the time that they are added to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Change of ownership or leasing.</E> An IRF hospital or IRF unit that undergoes a change of ownership or leasing, as defined in § 489.18 of this chapter, retains its excluded status and will continue to be paid under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(3) before and after the change of ownership or leasing if the new owner(s) of the IRF accept assignment of the previous owners' Medicare provider agreement and the IRF continues to meet all of the requirements for payment under the IRF prospective payment system. If the new owner(s) do not accept assignment of the previous owners' Medicare provider agreement, the IRF is considered to be voluntarily terminated and the new owner(s) may re-apply to participate in the Medicare program. If the IRF does not continue to meet all of the requirements for payment under the IRF prospective payment system, then the IRF loses its excluded status and is paid according to the prospective payment systems described in § 412.1(a)(1).</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Mergers.</E> If an IRF hospital (or a hospital with an IRF unit) merges with another hospital and the owner(s) of the merged hospital accept assignment of the IRF hospital's provider agreement (or the provider agreement of the hospital with the IRF unit), then the IRF hospital or IRF unit retains its excluded status and will continue to be paid under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(3) before and after the merger, as long as the IRF hospital or IRF unit continues to meet all of the requirements for payment under the IRF prospective payment system. If the owner(s) of the merged hospital do not accept assignment of the IRF hospital's provider agreement (or the provider agreement of the hospital with the IRF unit), then the IRF hospital or IRF unit is considered voluntarily terminated and the owner(s) of the merged hospital may reapply to the Medicare program to operate a new IRF.</P>
        <P>(d) Have in effect a preadmission screening procedure under which each prospective patient's condition and medical history are reviewed to determine whether the patient is likely to benefit significantly from an intensive inpatient hospital program. This procedure must ensure that the preadmission screening for each Medicare Part A Fee-for-Service patient is reviewed and approved by a rehabilitation physician prior to the patient's admission to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(e) Have in effect a procedure to ensure that patients receive close medical supervision, as evidenced by at least 3 face-to-face visits per week by a licensed physician with specialized training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation to assess the patient both medically and functionally, as well as to modify the course of treatment as needed to maximize the patient's capacity to benefit from the rehabilitation process.</P>

        <P>(f) Furnish, through the use of qualified personnel, rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, and occupational <PRTPAGE P="591"/>therapy, plus, as needed, speech-language pathology, social services, psychological services (including neuropsychological services), and orthotic and prosthetic services.</P>
        <P>(g) Have a director of rehabilitation who—</P>
        <P>(1) Provides services to the IRF hospital and its inpatients on a full-time basis or, in the case of a rehabilitation unit, at least 20 hours per week;</P>
        <P>(2) Is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy;</P>
        <P>(3) Is licensed under State law to practice medicine or surgery; and</P>
        <P>(4) Has had, after completing a one-year hospital internship, at least 2 years of training or experience in the medical-management of inpatients requiring rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>(h) Have a plan of treatment for each inpatient that is established, reviewed, and revised as needed by a physician in consultation with other professional personnel who provide services to the patient.</P>
        <P>(i) Use a coordinated interdisciplinary team approach in the rehabilitation of each inpatient, as documented by the periodic clinical entries made in the patient's medical record to note the patient's status in relationship to goal attainment and discharge plans, and that team conferences are held at least once per week to determine the appropriateness of treatment.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Retroactive adjustments.</E> If a new IRF (or new beds that are added to an existing IRF) are excluded from the prospective payment systems specified in § 412.1(a)(1) and paid under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(3) for a cost reporting period under paragraph (c) of this section, but the inpatient population actually treated during that period does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, we adjust payments to the IRF retroactively in accordance with the provisions in § 412.130.</P>

        <SECTNO>§ 412.42</SECTNO>
        <SUBJECT>Limitations on charges to beneficiaries.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Prohibited charges.</E> A hospital may not charge a beneficiary for any services for which payment is made by Medicare, even if the hospital's costs of furnishing services to that beneficiary are greater than the amount the hospital is paid under the prospective payment systems.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Permitted charges—Stay covered.</E> A hospital receiving payment under the prospective payment systems for a covered hospital stay (that is, a stay that includes at least one covered day) may charge the Medicare beneficiary or other person only for the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts under §§ 409.82, 409.83, and 409.87 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) Noncovered items and services, furnished at any time during a covered stay, unless they are excluded from coverage only on the basis of the following:</P>

        <P>(i) The exclusion of custodial care under § 405.310(g) of this chapter (see paragraph (c) of this section for when charges may be made for custodial care).<PRTPAGE P="592"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) The exclusion of medically unnecessary items and services under § 405.310(k) of this chapter (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for when charges may be made for medically unnecessary items and services).</P>
        <P>(iii) The exclusion under § 405.310(m) of this chapter of nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients by other than the hospital or a provider or supplier under arrangements made by the hospital.</P>
        <P>(iv) The exclusion of items and services furnished when the patient is not entitled to Medicare Part A benefits under subpart A of part 406 of this chapter (see paragraph (e) of this section for when charges may be made for items and services furnished when the patient is not entitled to benefits).</P>
        <P>(v) The exclusion of items and services furnished after Medicare Part A benefits are exhausted under § 409.61 of this chapter (see paragraph (e) of this section for when charges may be made for items and services furnished after benefits are exhausted).</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Custodial care and medically unnecessary inpatient hospital care.</E> A hospital may charge a beneficiary for services excluded from coverage on the basis of § 411.15(g) of this chapter (custodial care) or § 411.15(k) of this chapter (medically unnecessary services) and furnished by the hospital after all of the following conditions have been met:</P>
        <P>(1) The hospital (acting directly or through its utilization review committee) determines that the beneficiary no longer requires inpatient hospital care. (The phrase “inpatient hospital care” includes cases where a beneficiary needs a SNF level of care, but, under Medicare criteria, a SNF-level bed is not available. This also means that a hospital may find that a patient awaiting SNF placement no longer requires inpatient hospital care because either a SNF-level bed has become available or the patient no longer requires SNF-level care.)</P>
        <P>(2) The attending physician agrees with the hospital's determination in writing (for example, by issuing a written discharge order). If the hospital believes that the beneficiary does not require inpatient hospital care but is unable to obtain the agreement of the physician, it may request an immediate review of the case by the QIO as described in § 405.1208 of this chapter. Concurrence by the QIO in the hospital's determination will serve in lieu of the physician's agreement.</P>
        <P>(3) The hospital (acting directly or through its utilization review committee) notifies the beneficiary (or his or her representative) of his or her discharge rights in writing consistent with § 405.1205 and notifies the beneficiary, in accordance with § 405.1206 of this chapter (if applicable) that in the hospital's opinion, and with the attending physician's concurrence or that of the QIO, the beneficiary no longer requires inpatient hospital care.</P>
        <P>(4) If the beneficiary remains in the hospital after the appropriate notification, and the hospital, the physician who concurred in the hospital determination on which the notice was based, or QIO subsequently finds that the beneficiary requires an acute level of inpatient hospital care, the hospital may not charge the beneficiary for continued care until the hospital once again determines that the beneficiary no longer requires inpatient care, secures concurrence, and notifies the beneficiary, as required in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Medically unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic services.</E> A hospital may charge a beneficiary for diagnostic procedures and studies, and therapeutic procedures and courses of treatment (for example, experimental procedures) that are excluded from coverage under § 411.15(k) of this chapter (medically unnecessary items and services), even though the beneficiary requires continued inpatient hospital care, if those services are furnished after the beneficiary (or the person acting on his or her behalf) has acknowledged in writing that the hospital (acting directly or through its utilization review committee and with the concurrence of the intermediary) has informed him or her as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) In the hospital's opinion, which has been agreed to by the intermediary, the services to be furnished are not considered reasonable and necessary under Medicare.</P>

        <P>(2) Customary charges will be made if he or she receives the services.<PRTPAGE P="593"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) If the beneficiary receives the services, a formal determination on the validity of the hospital's finding is made by the intermediary and, to the extent that the decision requires the exercise of medical judgment, the QIO.</P>
        <P>(4) The determination is appealable by the hospital, the attending physician, or the beneficiary under the appeals procedure that applies to determinations affecting Medicare Part A payment.</P>
        <P>(5) The charges for the services will be invalid and, to the extent collected, will be refunded by the hospital if the services are found to be covered by Medicare.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Services furnished on days when the individual is not entitled to Medicare Part A benefits or has exhausted the available benefits.</E> The hospital may charge the beneficiary its customary charges for noncovered items and services furnished on outlier days (as described in Subpart F of this part) for which payment is denied because the beneficiary is not entitled to Medicare Part A or his or her Medicare Part A benefits are exhausted. (1) If payment is considered for outlier days, the entire stay is reviewed and days up to the number of days in excess of the outlier threshold may be denied on the basis of nonentitlement to Part A or exhaustion of benefits. (2) In applying this rule, the latest days will be denied first.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Differential for private room or other luxury services.</E> The hospital may charge the beneficiary the customary charge differential for a private room or other luxury service that is more expensive than is medically required and is furnished for the personal comfort of the beneficiary at his or her request (or the request of the person acting on his or her behalf).</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Review.</E> (1) The QIO or intermediary may review any cases in which the hospital advises the beneficiary (or the person acting on his or her behalf) of the noncoverage of the services in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) The hospital must identify such cases to the QIO or intermediary in accordance with CMS instructions.</P>

        <SUBJECT>DRG classification and weighting factors.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Diagnosis-related groups.</E> CMS establishs a classification of inpatient hospital discharges by Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">DRG weighting factors.</E> CMS assigns, for each DRG, an appropriate weighting factor that reflects the estimated relative cost of hospital resources used with respect to discharges classified within that group compared to discharges classified within other groups.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Assignment of discharges to DRGs.</E> CMS establishs a methodology for classifying specific hospital discharges within DRGs which ensures that each hospital discharge is appropriately assigned to a single DRG based on essential data abstracted from the inpatient bill for that discharge.</P>
        <P>(1) The classification of a particular discharge is based, as appropriate, on the patient's age, sex, principal diagnosis (that is, the diagnosis established after study to be chiefly responsible for causing the patient's admission to the hospital), secondary diagnoses, procedures performed, and discharge status.</P>
        <P>(2) Each discharge is assigned to only one DRG (related, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, to the patient's principal diagnosis) regardless of the number of conditions treated or services furnished during the patient's stay.</P>
        <P>(3) When the discharge data submitted by a hospital show a surgical procedure unrelated to a patient's principal diagnosis, the bill is returned to the hospital for validation and reverification. CMS's DRG classification system provides a DRG, and an appropriate weighting factor, for the group of cases for which the unrelated diagnosis and procedure are confirmed.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of DRG assignment.</E> (1) A hospital has 60 days after the date of the notice of the initial assignment of a discharge to a DRG to request a review of that assignment. The hospital may submit additional information as a part of its request.</P>
        <P>(2) The intermediary reviews the hospital's request and any additional information and decides whether a change in the DRG assignment is appropriate. If the intermediary decides that a higher-weighted DRG should be assigned, the case will be reviewed by the appropriate QIO as specified in § 466.71(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(3) Following the 60-day period described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the hospital may not submit additional information with respect to the DRG assignment or otherwise revise its claim.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Revision of DRG classification and weighting factors.</E> Beginning with discharges in fiscal year 1988, CMS adjusts the classifications and weighting factors established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section at least annually to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and other factors that may change the relative use of hospital resources.</P>

        <P>(f) <E T="03">Geographic classifications.</E> (1) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
        <P>(i) The term <E T="03">region</E> means one of the nine census divisions, comprising the fifty States and the District of Columbia, established by the Bureau of the Census for statistical and reporting purposes.</P>
        <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">urban area</E> means—</P>
        <P>(A) A Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or New England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA), as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget; or</P>
        <P>(B) The following New England counties, which are deemed to be parts of urban areas under section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-21, 42 U.S.C. 1395ww (note)): Litchfield County, Connecticut; York County, Maine; Sagadahoc County, Maine; Merrimack County, New Hampshire; and Newport County, Rhode Island.</P>
        <P>(iii) The term <E T="03">rural area</E> means any area outside an urban area.</P>
        <P>(iv) The phrase <E T="03">hospital reclassified as rural</E> means a hospital located in a county that was part of an MSA or NECMA, as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget, but is not part of an MSA or NECMA as a result of an Executive Office of Management and Budget redesignation occurring after April 20, 1983.</P>
        <P>(2) For hospitals within an MSA or NECMA that crosses census division boundaries, the following provisions apply:</P>
        <P>(i) The MSA or NECMA is deemed to belong to the census division in which most of the hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are located.</P>
        <P>(ii) If a hospital would receive a lower Federal rate because most of the hospitals are located in a census division with a lower Federal rate than the rate applicable to the census division in which the hospital is located, the payment rate will not be reduced for the hospital's cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 1984.</P>
        <P>(iii) If an equal number of hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are located in each census division, such hospitals are deemed to be in the census division with the higher Federal rate.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Adjusting the average standardized amounts.</E> CMS adjusts each of the average standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this <PRTPAGE P="597"/>section by factors representing CMS's estimates of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The amount of payment that would have been made under Medicare Part B for nonphysician services to hospital inpatients during the first cost reporting period subject to prospective payment were it not for the fact that such services must be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements in order for any Medicare payment to be made after September 30, 1983 (the effective date of § 405.310(m) of this chapter).</P>
        <P>(2) The amount of FICA taxes that would be incurred during the first cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system, by hospitals that had not incurred such taxes for any or all of their employees during the base period described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Reducing for value of outlier payments.</E> CMS reduces each of the adjusted average standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by CMS) of the total amount of payments based on DRG prospective payment rates that are additional payments for outlier cases under subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Maintaining budget neutrality.</E> (1) CMS adjusts each of the reduced standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section as required for fiscal year 1984 so that the estimated amount of aggregate payments made, excluding the hospital-specific portion (that is, the total of the Federal portion of transition payments, plus any adjustments and special treatment of certain classes of hospitals for Federal fiscal year 1984) is not greater or less than 25 percent of the payment amounts that would have been payable for the inpatient operating costs for those same hospitals for fiscal year 1984 under the Social Security Act as in effect on April 19, 1983.</P>
        <P>(2) The aggregate payments considered under this paragraph exclude payments for per case review by a utilization and quality control quality improvement organization, as allowed under section 1866(a)(1)(F) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Computing Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for urban and rural hospitals in the United States and in each region.</E> For each discharge classified within a DRG, CMS establishes a national prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs and a regional prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each region, as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) For hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or in that region respectively, the rate equals the product of—</P>
        <P>(i) The adjusted average standardized amount (computed under paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section) for hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or in that region; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The weighting factor determined under § 412.60(b) for that DRG.</P>
        <P>(2) For hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or in that region respectively, the rate equals the product of—</P>
        <P>(i) The adjusted average standardized amount (computed under paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section) for hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or that region; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The weighting factor determined under § 412.60(b) for that DRG.</P>
        <P>(k) <E T="03">Adjusting for different area wage levels.</E> CMS adjusts the proportion (as estimated by CMS from time to time) of Federal rates computed under paragraph (j) of this section that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs, for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by CMS) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section) of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.</P>

        <P>(2) Each such rate is determined for hospitals located in urban or rural areas within the United States and within each such region, respectively, as described under paragraphs (b) through (u) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Geographic classifications.</E> Effective for fiscal years 1985 through 2004, the following rules apply.</P>
        <P>(1) For purposes of this section, the definitions set forth in § 412.62(f) apply, except that, effective January 1, 2000, a hospital reclassified as rural may mean a reclassification that results from a geographic redesignation as set forth in § 412.62(f)(1)(iv) or a reclassification that results from an urban hospital applying for reclassification as rural as set forth in § 412.103.</P>
        <P>(2) For hospitals within an MSA or NECMA that crosses census division boundaries, the following provisions apply:</P>
        <P>(i) The MSA or NECMA is deemed to belong to the census division in which most of the hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are located.</P>
        <P>(ii) A hospital that met the conditions specified in § 412.62(f)(2)(ii) and therefore did not receive a lower Federal rate that would have applied for cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1984, receives the lower Federal rate applicable to all hospitals in the MSA or NECMA in which it is located effective with the hospital's cost reporting period that begins on or after October 1, 1984.</P>
        <P>(iii) The higher Federal rate is payable to all hospitals in the MSA or NECMA if an equal number of hospitals within the MSA or NECMA are located in each census division.</P>

        <P>(3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, a hospital located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount for the urban area to which the greater number of workers in the county commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs or NECMAs if the commuting rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or central counties of all adjacent MSAs or NECMAs. These EOMB standards are set forth in the notice of final standards for classification of MSAs published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 3, 1980 (45 FR 956), and available from CMS, East High Rise Building, room 132, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207.</P>
        <P>(4) For purposes of this section, any change in an MSA or NECMA designation is recognized on the October 1 following the effective date of the change.</P>
        <P>(5) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, for hospitals that consist of two or more separately located inpatient hospital facilities the national adjusted prospective payment rate is based on the geographic location of the hospital facility at which the discharge occurs.</P>

For discharges occurring in fiscal year 2004, CMS computes an average standardized amount for hospitals located in all areas.</P>
        <P>(2) Each of those amounts is equal to the respective adjusted average standardized amount computed for fiscal year 1984 under § 412.62(g)—</P>
        <P>(i) Increased for fiscal year 1985 by the applicable percentage increase in the hospital market basket;</P>
        <P>(ii) Adjusted by the estimated amount of Medicare payment for nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients that would have been paid under Part B were it not for the fact that such services must be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements;</P>

        <P>(iii) Reduced by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by CMS) of <PRTPAGE P="599"/>the total amount of prospective payments that are additional payment amounts attributable to outlier cases under subpart F of this part; and</P>
        <P>(iv) Adjusted for budget neutrality under paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) For fiscal year 1986 and thereafter. CMS computes, for urban and rural hospitals in the United States and for urban and rural hospitals in each region, average standardized amount equal to the respective adjusted average standardized amounts computed for the previous fiscal year—</P>
        <P>(i) Increased by the applicable percentage increase determined under paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section;</P>
        <P>(ii) Adjusted by the estimated amount of Medicare payment for nonphysician services furnished to hospital inpatients that would have been paid under Part B were it not for the fact that such services must be furnished either directly by hospitals or under arrangements; and</P>
        <P>(iii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1985 and before October 1, 1986, reduced by a proportion (estimated by CMS) of the amount of payments based on the total amount of prospective payments that are additional payment amounts attributable to outlier cases under subpart F of this part, and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, reduced by a proportion (estimated by CMS) of the amount of payments that, based on the total amount of prospective payments for urban hospitals and the total amount of prospective payments for rural hospitals, are additional payments attributable to outlier cases in such hospitals under subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(4) For fiscal years 1987 through 1990 CMS standardizes the average standardized amounts by excluding an estimate of the payments for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.</P>
        <P>(5) For fiscal years 1987 through 2004, CMS standardizes the average standardized amounts by excluding an estimate of indirect medical education payments.</P>

        <P>(6) For fiscal years 1988 through 2003, CMS computes average standardized amounts for hospitals located in large urban areas, other urban areas, and rural areas. The term <E T="03">large urban area</E> means an MSA with a population of more than 1,000,000 or an NECMA, with a population of more than 970,000 based on the most recent available population data published by the Census Bureau.

        <SUBJECT>Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for Federal fiscal year 2005 and subsequent fiscal years.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> CMS determines a national adjusted prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each inpatient hospital discharge in Federal fiscal year 2005 and subsequent fiscal years involving inpatient hospital services of a hospital in the United States subject to the prospective payment system for which payment may be made under Medicare Part A.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Geographic classifications.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
        <P>(i) The term <E T="03">region</E> means one of the 9 metropolitan divisions comprising the 50 States and the District of Columbia, established by the Executive Office of Management and Budget for statistical and reporting purposes.</P>
        <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">urban area</E> means—</P>
        <P>(A) A Metropolitan Statistical Area or a Metropolitan division (in the case where a Metropolitan Statistical Area is divided into Metropolitan Divisions), as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget; or</P>
        <P>(B) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 2007, the following New England counties are deemed to be parts of urban areas under section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-21, 42 U.S.C. 1395ww (note); Litchfield County, Connecticut; York County, Maine; Sagadahoc County, Maine; Merrimack County, New Hampshire; and Newport County, Rhode Island.</P>
        <P>(C) The term <E T="03">rural area</E> means any area outside an urban area.</P>
        <P>(2) For hospitals within an MSA that crosses census division boundaries, the MSA is deemed to belong to the census division in which most of the hospitals within the MSA are located.</P>

        <P>(3)(i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, a hospital that is located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount for the urban area to which the greater <PRTPAGE P="603"/>number of workers in the county commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs if the commuting rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or central counties of all adjacent MSAs. Qualifying counties are determined based upon OMB standards, using the most recent OMB standards for delineating statistical areas adopted by CMS.</P>
        <P>(ii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007, hospitals in the following New England counties, if not already located in an urban area, are deemed to be located in urban areas under section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-21, 42 U.S.C. 1395ww (note): Litchfield County, Connecticut; York County, Maine; Sagadahoc County, Maine; Merrimack County, New Hampshire; and Newport County, Rhode Island.</P>
        <P>(4) For purposes of this section, any change in an MSA designation is recognized on October 1 following the effective date of the change. Such a change in MSA designation may occur as a result of redesignation of an MSA by the Executive Office of Management and Budget.</P>
        <P>(5) For hospitals that consist of two or more separately located inpatient hospital facilities, the national adjusted prospective payment rate is based on the geographic location of the hospital facility at which the discharge occurred.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Computing the standardized amount.</E> CMS computes an average standardized amount that is applicable to all hospitals located in all areas, updated by the applicable percentage increase specified in paragraph (d) of this section. CMS standardizes the average standardized amount by excluding an estimate of indirect medical education payments.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicable percentage change for fiscal year 2005 and for subsequent fiscal years.</E> (1) The applicable percentage change for updating the standardized amount for all hospitals in all areas is—</P>

        <P>(4) <E T="03">Exception</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rules.</E> The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt an eligible hospital that is not a qualifying eligible hospital from the application of the reduction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user would result in a significant hardship for the eligible hospital.</P>
        <P>(ii) To be considered for an exception, a hospital must submit an application, in the manner specified by CMS, demonstrating that it meets one or more than one of the criteria specified in this paragraph (d)(4) of this section. These types of exceptions are subject to annual renewal, but in no case may a hospital be granted this type of exception for more than 5 years. (See § 495.4 for definitions of payment adjustment year, EHR reporting period, and meaningful EHR user.)</P>

        <P>(A) During any 90-day period from the beginning of the fiscal year that is 2 years before the payment adjustment year to July 1 of the year before the payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS, the hospital was located in an area without sufficient Internet access to comply with the meaningful use objectives requiring internet connectivity, and faced insurmountable barriers to obtaining such internet connectivity. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted by July 1 of the year before the <PRTPAGE P="605"/>applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS.</P>
        <P>(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) During the fiscal year that is 2 fiscal years before the payment adjustment year, the hospital that has previously demonstrated meaningful use faces extreme and uncontrollable circumstances that prevent it from becoming a meaningful EHR user. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted by July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) During the fiscal year preceding the payment adjustment year, the hospital that has not previously demonstrated meaningful use faces extreme and uncontrollable circumstances that prevent it from becoming a meaningful EHR user. Applications requesting this exception must be submitted by July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS.</P>
        <P>(C) The hospital is new in the payment adjustment year, and has not previously operated (under previous or present ownership). This exception expires beginning with the first Federal fiscal year that begins on or after the hospital has had at least one 12-month (or longer) cost reporting period after they accept their first Medicare covered patient. For purposes of this exception, the following hospitals are not considered new hospitals:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A hospital that builds new or replacement facilities at the same or another location even if coincidental with a change of ownership, a change in management, or a lease arrangement.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A hospital that closes and subsequently reopens.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A hospital that changes its status from a CAH to a hospital that is subject to the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exception for decertified EHR technology.</E> Beginning with the fiscal year 2019 payment adjustment year, the Secretary shall exempt an eligible hospital that is not a qualifying eligible hospital from the application of the reduction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user is not possible because the certified EHR technology used by the eligible hospital has been decertified under ONC's Health IT Certification Program. To be considered for an exception, an eligible hospital must submit an application, in the manner specified by CMS, demonstrating that the certified EHR technology was decertified during the 12-month period preceding the applicable EHR reporting period for the payment adjustment year, or during the applicable EHR reporting period for the payment adjustment year, and that the eligible hospital made a good faith effort to obtain another certified EHR technology for that EHR reporting period. (See § 495.4 of this chapter for definitions of payment adjustment year, EHR reporting period, and meaningful EHR user.) Applications requesting this exception must be submitted by July 1 of the year before the applicable payment adjustment year, or a later date specified by CMS. This exception is subject to annual renewal, but in no case may an eligible hospital be granted an exception under paragraph (d)(4) of this section for more than 5 years.</P>
        <P>(5) A State in which hospitals are paid for services under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act must—</P>
        <P>(i) Adjust the payments to each eligible hospital in the State that is not a meaningful EHR user in a manner that is designed to result in an aggregate reduction in payments to hospitals in the State that is equivalent to the aggregate reduction that would have occurred if payments had been reduced to each eligible hospital in the State in a manner comparable to the reduction under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Provide to the Secretary, by January 1, 2013, a report on the method that it proposes to employ in order to make the requisite payment adjustment described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Maintaining budget neutrality.</E> (1) CMS makes an adjustment to the standardized amount to ensure that—</P>

        <P>(i) Changes to the DRG classifications and recalibrations of the DRG relative weights are made in a manner so that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected; and<PRTPAGE P="606"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the annual updates and adjustments to the wage index under paragraph (h) of this section are made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments are not affected; and</P>
        <P>(2) CMS also makes an adjustment to the rates to ensure that aggregate payments after implementation of reclassifications under subpart L of this part are equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made in the absence of these provisions.</P>
        <P>(3) To the extent CMS determines that changes to the DRG classification and recalibrations of the DRG relative weights for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in coding or classification of discharges that do not reflect real changes in case mix, CMS may adjust the standardized amount for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding and classification changes.</P>
        <P>(4) CMS makes an adjustment to the wage index to ensure that aggregate payments after implementation of the rural floor under section 4410 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) and the imputed floor under paragraph (h)(4) of this section are equal to the aggregate prospective payments that would have been made in the absence of such provisions as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) Beginning October 1, 2008, such adjustment is transitioned from a nationwide to a statewide adjustment as follows:</P>
        <P>(A) From October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009, the wage index is a blend of 20 percent of a wage index with a statewide adjustment and 80 percent of a wage index with a nationwide adjustment.</P>
        <P>(B) From October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010, the wage index is a blend of 50 percent of a wage index with a statewide adjustment and 50 percent of a wage index with a nationwide adjustment.</P>
        <P>(ii) Beginning October 1, 2010, such adjustment is a full nationwide adjustment.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Adjustment for outlier payments.</E> CMS reduces the adjusted average standardized amount determined under paragraph (c) through (e) of this section by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by CMS) to the total amount of payments based on DRG prospective payment rates that are additional payments for outlier cases under subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Computing Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for hospitals located in all areas.</E> For each discharge classified within a DRG, CMS establishes for the fiscal year a national prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs based on the standardized amount for the fiscal year and the weighting factor determined under § 412.60(b) for that DRG.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Adjusting for different area wage levels.</E> CMS adjusts the proportion of the Federal rate for inpatient operating costs that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by CMS based on survey data) reflecting the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of the hospital compared to the national average level of hospital wages and wage-related costs. The adjustment described in this paragraph (h) also takes into account the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category.</P>
        <P>(1) The wage index is updated annually.</P>
        <P>(2) CMS determines the proportion of the Federal rate that is attributable to wages and labor-related costs from time to time, employing a methodology that is described in the annual regulation updating the system of payment for inpatient hospital operating costs.</P>

        <P>(3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS employs 62 percent as the proportion of the rate that is adjusted for the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs, unless employing that percentage would result in lower payments for the hospital than employing the proportion <PRTPAGE P="607"/>determined under the methodology described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) For discharges on or after October 1, 2004 and before October 1, 2018, CMS establishes a minimum wage index for each all-urban State, as defined in paragraph (h)(5) of this section. This minimum wage index value is computed using the following methodology:</P>
        <P>(i) CMS computes the ratio of the lowest-to-highest wage index for each all-urban State;</P>
        <P>(ii) CMS computes the average of the ratios of the lowest-to-highest wage indexes of all the all-urban States;</P>
        <P>(iii) For each all-urban State, CMS determines the higher of the State's own lowest-to-highest rate (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section) or the average lowest-to-highest rate (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section);</P>
        <P>(iv) For each State, CMS multiplies the rate determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section by the highest wage index value in the State;</P>
        <P>(v) The product determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section is the minimum wage index value for the State, except as provided under paragraph (h)(4)(vi) of this section;</P>
        <P>(vi) For discharges on or after October 1, 2012 and before October 1, 2018, the minimum wage index value for the State is the higher of the value determined under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section or the value computed using the following alternative methodology:</P>
        <P>(A) CMS estimates a percentage representing the average percentage increase in wage index for hospitals receiving the rural floor due to such floor.</P>
        <P>(B) For each all-urban State, CMS makes a onetime determination of the lowest hospital wage index in the State (including all adjustments to the hospital's wage index, except for the rural floor, the rural floor budget neutrality, and the outmigration adjustment) and increases this wage index by the percentage determined under paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(A) of this section, the result of which establishes the alternative minimum wage index value for the State.</P>
        <P>(5) An all-urban State is a State with no rural areas, as defined in this section, or a State in which there are no hospitals classified as rural. A State with rural areas and with hospitals reclassified as rural under § 412.103 in not an all-urban State.</P>
        <P>(6) If a new rural hospital that is subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system opens in a State that has an imputed rural floor and has rural areas, CMS uses the imputed floor as the hospital's wage index until the hospital's first cost report as an inpatient prospective payment system provider is contemporaneous with the cost reporting period being used to develop a given fiscal year's wage index.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Adjusting the wage index to account for commuting patterns of hospital workers</E>—(1) <E T="03">General criteria.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS adjusts the hospital wage index for hospitals located in qualifying counties to recognize the commuting patterns of hospital employees. A qualifying county is a county that meets all of the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) Hospital employees in the county commute to work in an MSA (or MSAs) with a wage index (or wage indices) higher than the wage index of the MSA or rural statewide area in which the county is located.</P>
        <P>(ii) At least 10 percent of the county's hospital employees commute to an MSA (or MSAs) with a higher wage index (or wage indices).</P>
        <P>(iii) The 3-year average hourly wage of the hospital(s) in the county equals or exceeds the 3-year average hourly wage of all hospitals in the MSA or rural statewide area in which the county is located.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Amount of adjustment.</E> A hospital located in a county that meets the criteria under paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iii) of this section will receive an increase in its wage index that is equal to a weighted average of the difference between the postreclassified wage index of the MSA (or MSAs) with the higher wage index (or wage indices) and the postreclassified wage index of the MSA or rural statewide area in which the qualifying county is located, weighted by the overall percentage of the hospital employees residing in the qualifying county who are employed in any MSA with a higher wage index.<PRTPAGE P="608"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Process for determining the adjustment.</E> (i) CMS will use the most accurate data available, as determined by CMS, to determine the out-migration percentage for each county.</P>
        <P>(ii) CMS will include, in its annual proposed and final notices of updates to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, a listing of qualifying counties and the hospitals that are eligible to receive the adjustment to their wage indexes for commuting hospital employees, and the wage index increase applicable to each qualifying county.</P>
        <P>(iii) Any wage index adjustment made under this paragraph (i) is effective for a period of 3 fiscal years, except that hospitals in a qualifying county may elect to waive the application of the wage index adjustment. A hospital may waive the application of the wage index adjustment by notifying CMS in writing within 45 days of the date of public display of the annual notice of proposed rulemaking for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system at the Office of the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(iv) A hospital in a qualifying county that receives a wage index adjustment under this paragraph (i) is not eligible for reclassification under subpart L of this part or section 1886(d)(8) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(j) <E T="03">Wage index assignment for rural referral centers for FY 2005.</E> (1) CMS makes an exception to the wage index assignment of a rural referral center for FY 2005 if the rural referral center meets the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(i) The rural referral center was reclassified for FY 2004 by the MGCRB to another MSA, but, upon applying to the MGCRB for FY 2005, was found to be ineligible for reclassification because its average hourly wage was less than 84 percent (but greater than 82 percent) of the average hourly wage of the hospitals geographically located in the MSA to which the rural referral center applied for reclassification for FY 2005.</P>
        <P>(ii) The hospital may not qualify for any geographic reclassification under subpart L of this part, effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004.</P>
        <P>(2) CMS will assign a rural referral center that meets the conditions of paragraph (j)(1) of this section the wage index value of the MSA to which it was reclassified by the MGCRB in FY 2004. The wage index assignment is applicable for discharges occurring during the 3-year period beginning October 1, 2004 and ending September 30, 2007.</P>
        <P>(k) <E T="03">Midyear corrections to the wage index.</E> (1) CMS makes a midyear correction to the wage index for an area only if a hospital can show that—</P>
        <P>(i) The intermediary or CMS made an error in tabulating its data; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The hospital could not have known about the error, or did not have the opportunity to correct the error, before the beginning of the Federal fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, a midyear correction to the wage index is effective prospectively from the date the change is made to the wage index.</P>
        <P>(ii) Effective October 1, 2005, a change to the wage index may be made retroactively to the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, if, for the fiscal year in question, CMS determines all of the following—</P>
        <P>(A) The fiscal intermediary or CMS made an error in tabulating data used for the wage index calculation;</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital knew about the error in its wage data and requested the fiscal intermediary and CMS to correct the error both within the established schedule for requesting corrections to the wage data (which is at least before the beginning of the fiscal year for the applicable update to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system) and using the established process; and</P>
        <P>(C) CMS agreed before October 1 that the fiscal intermediary or CMS made an error in tabulating the hospital's wage data and the wage index should be corrected.</P>
        <P>(l) <E T="03">Judicial decision.</E> If a judicial decision reverses a CMS denial of a hospital's wage data revision request, CMS pays the hospital by applying a revised wage index that reflects the revised wage data as if CMS's decision had been favorable rather than unfavorable.</P>

          <E T="03">General criteria.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2010, CMS adjusts the hospital wage index for hospitals located in qualifying States to recognize the wage index floor established for frontier States. A qualifying frontier State meets both of the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) At least 50 percent of counties located within the State have a reported population density less than 6 persons per square mile.</P>
        <P>(ii) The State does not receive a nonlabor-related share adjustment determined by the Secretary to take into account the unique circumstances of hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Amount of wage index adjustment.</E> A hospital located in a qualifying State will receive a wage index value not less than 1.00.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Process for determining and posting wage index adjustments.</E> (i) CMS uses the most recent Population Estimate data published by the U.S. Census Bureau to determine county definitions and population density. This analysis will be periodically revised, such as for updates to the decennial census data.</P>

        <P>(ii) CMS will include a listing of qualifying frontier States and denote the hospitals receiving a wage index increase attributable to this provision in its annual updates to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

        <SUBJECT>Determination of base-year inpatient operating costs.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Base-year costs.</E> (1) For each hospital, the intermediary will estimate the hospital's Medicare Part A allowable inpatient operating costs, as described in § 412.2(c), for the 12-month or longer cost reporting period ending on or after September 30, 1982 and before September 30, 1983.</P>
        <P>(2) If the hospital's last cost reporting period ending before September 30, 1983 is for less than 12 months, the base period will be the hospital's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period ending before such short reporting period, with an appropriate adjustment for inflation. (The rules applicable to new hospitals are set forth in § 412.74.)</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Modifications to base-year costs.</E> Prior to determining the hospital-specific rate, the intermediary will adjust the hospital's estimated base-year inpatient operating costs, as necessary, to include malpractice insurance costs in accordance with § 413.53(a)(1)(i) of this chapter, and exclude the following:</P>
        <P>(1) Medical education costs as described in § 413.85 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) Capital-related costs as described in § 413.130 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(3) Kidney acquisition costs incurred by hospitals approved as renal transplantation centers as described in § 412.100. Kidney acquisition costs in the base year will be determined by multiplying the hospital's average kidney acquisition cost per kidney times the number of kidney transplants covered by Medicare Part A during the base period.</P>
        <P>(4) Higher costs that were incurred for purposes of increasing base-year costs.</P>
        <P>(5) One-time nonrecurring higher costs or revenue offsets that have the effect of distorting base-year costs as an appropriate basis for computing the hospital-specific rate.</P>

        <P>(6) Higher costs that result from changes in hospital accounting principles initiated in the base year.<PRTPAGE P="610"/>
        </P>
        <P>(7) The costs of qualified nonphysician anesthetists' services, as described in § 412.113(c).</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Hospital's request for adjustment of base-year inpatient operating costs.</E> (1) Before the date it becomes subject to the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, a hospital may request the intermediary to further adjust its estimated base-period costs to take into account the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Services paid for under Medicare Part B during the hospital's base year that will be paid for under prospective payments. The base-year costs may be increased to include estimated payments for certain services previously billed as physicians' services before the effective date of § 415.102(a) of this chapter, and estimated payments for nonphysicians' services that were not furnished either directly or under arrangements before October 1, 1983 (the effective date of § 405.310(m) of this chapter), but may not include the costs of anesthetists' services for which a physician employer continues to bill under § 405.553(b)(4) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) The payment of FICA taxes during cost reporting periods subject to the prospective payment system, if the hospital had not paid such taxes for all its employees during its base period and will be required to participate effective January 1, 1984.</P>
        <P>(2) If a hospital requests that its base-period costs be adjusted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it must timely provide the intermediary with sufficient documentation to justify the adjustment, and adequate data to compute the adjusted costs. The intermediary decides whether to use part or all of the data on the basis of audit, survey and other information available.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Intermediary's determination.</E> The intermediary uses the best data available at the time in estimating each hospital's base-year costs and the modifications to those costs authorized by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The intermediary's estimate of base-year costs and modifications thereto is final and may not be changed after the first day of the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1983, except as provided in § 412.72.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Modification of base-year costs.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Bases for modification of base-year costs.</E> Base-year costs as determined under § 412.71(d) may be modified under the following circumstances:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Inadvertent omissions.</E> (i) A hospital that becomes subject to the prospective payment system beginning on or after October 1, 1983 and before November 16, 1983 has until November 15, 1983 to request its intermediary to reestimate its base-period costs to take into account inadvertent omissions in its previous submissions to the intermediary related to changes made by the prospective payment legislation for purposes of estimating the base-period costs.</P>
        <P>(ii) The intermediary may also initiate changes to the estimation—</P>
        <P>(A) For any reason before the date the hospital becomes subject to prospective payment; and</P>
        <P>(B) Before November 16, 1983, for corrections to take into account inadvertent omissions in the hospital's previous submissions related to changes made by the prospective payment legislation for purposes of estimating the base-period costs.</P>
        <P>(iii) Such omissions pertain to adjustments to exclude capital-related costs and the direct medical education costs of approved educational activities and to adjustments specified in § 412.71(c).</P>
        <P>(iv) The intermediary must notify the provider of any change to the hospital-specific amount as a result of the provider's request within 30 days of receipt of the additional data.</P>
        <P>(v) Any change to base-period costs made under this paragraph (a)(1) will be made effective retroactively, beginning with the first day of the affected hospital's fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Correction of mathematical errors of calculations.</E> (i) The hospital must report mathematical errors of calculations to the intermediary within 90 <PRTPAGE P="611"/>days of the intermediary's notification to the hospital of the hospital's payments rates.</P>
        <P>(ii) The intermediary may also identify such errors and initiate their correction during this period.</P>
        <P>(iii) The intermediary will either make an appropriate adjustment or notify the hospital that no adjustment is warranted within 30 days of receipt of the hospital's report of an error.</P>
        <P>(iv) Corrections of errors of calculation will be effective with the first day of the hospital's first cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Recognition of additional costs.</E> (i) The intermediary may adjust base-period costs to take into account additional costs recognized as allowable costs for the hospital's base year as the result of any of the following:</P>
        <P>(A) A reopening and revision of the hospital's base-year notice of amount of program reimbursement under §§ 405.1885 through 405.1889 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(B) A prehearing order or finding issued during the provider payment appeals process by the appropriate reviewing authority under § 405.1821 or § 405.1853 of this chapter that resolved a matter at issue in the hospital's base-year notice of amount of program reimbursement.</P>
        <P>(C) An affirmation, modification, or reversal of a Provider Reimbursement Review Board decision by the Administrator of CMS under § 405.1875 of this chapter that resolved a matter at issue in the hospital's base-year notice of amount of program reimbursement.</P>
        <P>(D) An administrative or judicial review decision under § 405.1831, § 405.1871, or § 405.1877 of this chapter that is final and no longer subject to review under applicable law or regulations by a higher reviewing authority, and that resolved a matter at issue in the hospital's base-year notice of amount of program reimbursement.</P>
        <P>(ii) The intermediary will recalculate the hospital's base-year costs, incorporating the additional costs recognized as allowable for the hospital's base year. Adjustments to base-year costs to take into account these additional costs—</P>
        <P>(A) Will be effective with the first day of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after the date of the revision, order or finding, or review decision; and</P>
        <P>(B) Will not be used to recalculate the hospital-specific portion as determined for fiscal years beginning before the date of the revision, order or finding, or review decision.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Successful appeal.</E> The intermediary may modify base-year costs to take into account a successful appeal relating to modifications to base-year costs that were made under § 412.71(b). If a hospital successfully contests a modification to base-year costs—</P>
        <P>(i) The intermediary will recalculate the hospital's base-year costs to reflect the modification determined appropriate as a result of the appeal; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Such adjustments will be effective retroactively to the time of the intermediary's initial estimation of base-year costs.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Unlawfully claimed costs.</E> The intermediary may modify base-year costs to exclude costs that were unlawfully claimed as determined as a result of criminal conviction, imposition of a civil judgment under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731), or a proceeding for exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition to adjusting base-year costs, CMS will recover both the excess costs reimbursed for the base period and the additional amounts paid due to the inappropriate increase of the hospital-specific portion of the hospital's transition payment rates. The amount to be recovered will be computed on the basis of the final resolution of the amount of the inappropriate base-year costs.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Right to administrative and judicial review.</E> (1) An intermediary's estimation of a hospital's base-year costs, and modifications, made for purposes of determining the hospital-specific rate, are subject to administrative and judicial review. Review will be available to a hospital upon receipt of its notice of amount of program reimbursement following the close of its cost reporting period, but only with respect to whether the intermediary followed the provisions of §§ 412.71 and 412.72. (Sections 405.1803 and 405.1807 of this chapter set forth the rules for <PRTPAGE P="612"/>intermediary determinations and notice of amount of program reimbursement and the effect of those determinations.)</P>
        <P>(2) In any administrative or judicial review of whether the intermediary used the best data available at the time, as required by § 412.71(d), an intermediary's estimation will be revised on the basis of this review only if the estimation was unreasonable and clearly erroneous in light of the data available at the time the estimation was made.</P>
        <P>(3) Specifically excluded from administrative or judicial review are any issues based on data, information, or arguments not presented to the intermediary at the time of the estimation.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Determination of the hospital-specific rate based on a Federal fiscal year 1982 base period.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Costs on a per discharge basis.</E> The intermediary will determine the hospital's estimated adjusted base-year operating cost per discharge by dividing the total adjusted operating costs by the number of discharges in the base period.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Case-mix adjustment.</E> The intermediary will divide the adjusted base-year costs by the hospital's 1981 case-mix index. If the hospital's case-mix index is statistically unreliable (as determined by CMS), the hospital's base-year costs will be divided by the lower of the following:</P>
        <P>(1) The hospital's estimated case-mix index.</P>
        <P>(2) The average case-mix index for the appropriate classifications of all hospitals subject to cost limits established under § 413.30 of this chapter for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1982 and before October 1, 1983.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Updating base-year costs</E>—(1) <E T="03">For Federal fiscal year 1984.</E> The case-mix adjusted base-year cost per discharge will be updated by the applicable updating factor, that is, the rate-of-increase percentage determined under § 413.40(c)(3) of this chapter, as adjusted for budget neutrality.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">For Federal fiscal year 1985.</E> The amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be updated by the applicable updating factor, as adjusted for budget neutrality.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">For Federal fiscal year 1986.</E> (i) The amount determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is updated by—</P>

        <P>(A) For the first 51 days of the hospital's cost reporting period, by zero percent.</P>
        <P>(B) For the next 132 days of the hospital's cost reporting period, by 2.7 percent.</P>

        <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (i) If the MDH's last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2002, is for less than 12 months, the base period is the MDH's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period beginning before that short cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(ii) If the MDH does not have a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2001, and before October 1, 2002, and does have a cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2000, and before October 1, 2001, that cost reporting period is the base period unless the cost reporting is for less than 12 months. In that case, the base period is the MDH's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period beginning before that short cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Costs on a per discharge basis.</E> The intermediary determines the MDH's average base-period operating cost per discharge by dividing the total operating costs by the number of discharges in the base period.

        <P>(h) <E T="03">Modification of hospital-specific rate.</E> (1) The intermediary recalculates the hospital-specific rate to reflect the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Any modifications that are determined as a result of administrative or judicial review of the hospital-specific rate determinations; or</P>
        <P>(ii) Any additional costs that are recognized as allowable costs for the MDH's base period as a result of administrative or judicial review of the base-period notice of amount of program reimbursement.</P>

        <P>(iii) An affirmation, modification, or reversal of a Provider Reimbursement Review Board decision by the Administrator of CMS under § 405.1875 of this chapter that resolved a matter at issue in the hospital's base-period notice of amount of program reimbursement.</P>

        <P>(iv) An administrative or judicial review decision under § 405.1831, § 405.1871, or § 405.1877 of this chapter that is final and no longer subject to review under <PRTPAGE P="620"/>applicable law or regulations by a higher reviewing authority, and that resolved a matter at issue in the hospital's base-period notice of amount of program reimbursement.</P>

          <P>(a) For discharges occurring before October 1, 1997, if the hospital stay reflected by a discharge includes covered days of care beyond the applicable threshold criterion, the intermediary will make an additional payment, on a per diem basis, to the discharging hospital for those days. A special request or submission by the hospital is not necessary to initiate this payment.

          <P>(a) A hospital may request its intermediary to make an additional payment for inpatient hospital services that meet the criteria established in accordance with § 412.80(a).</P>
          <P>(b) The hospital must request additional payment—</P>
          <P>(1) With initial submission of the bill; or</P>
          <P>(2) Within 60 days of receipt of the intermediary's initial determination.</P>
          <P>(c) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, an additional payment for a cost outlier case is made prior to medical review.</P>
          <P>(d) As described in paragraph (f) of this section, the QIO reviews a sample of cost outlier cases after payment. The charges for any services identified as noncovered through this review are denied and any outlier payment made for these services are recovered, as appropriate, after a determination as to the provider's liability has been made.</P>

          <P>(e) If the QIO finds a pattern of inappropriate utilization by a hospital, all cost outlier cases from that hospital are subject to medical review, and this <PRTPAGE P="622"/>review may be conducted prior to payment until the QIO determines that appropriate corrective actions have been taken.</P>
          <P>(f) The QIO reviews the cost outlier cases, using the medical records and itemized charges, to verify the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The admission was medically necessary and appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) Services were medically necessary and delivered in the most appropriate setting.</P>
          <P>(3) Services were ordered by the physician, actually furnished, and not duplicatively billed.</P>
          <P>(4) The diagnostic and procedural codings are correct.</P>
          <P>(g) The intermediary bases the operating and capital costs of the discharge on the billed charges for covered inpatient services adjusted by the cost to charge ratios applicable to operating and capital costs, respectively, as described in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

          <P>(h) For discharges occurring before October 1, 2003, the operating and capital cost-to-charge ratios used to adjust covered charges are computed annually by the intermediary for each hospital based on the latest available settled cost report for that hospital and charge data for the same time period as that covered by the cost report. For discharges occurring before August 8, 2003, statewide cost-to-charge ratios are used in those instances in which a hospital's operating or capital cost-to-charge ratios fall outside reasonable parameters. CMS sets forth the reasonable parameters and the statewide cost-to-charge ratios in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with § 412.8(b).</P>
          <P>(i)(1) For discharges occurring on or after August 8, 2003, CMS may specify an alternative to the ratios otherwise applicable under paragraphs (h) or (i)(2) of this section. A hospital may also request that its fiscal intermediary use a different (higher or lower) cost-to-charge ratio based on substantial evidence presented by the hospital. Such a request must be approved by the CMS Regional Office.</P>
          <P>(2) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2003, the operating and capital cost-to-charge ratios applied at the time a claim is processed are based on either the most recent settled cost report or the most recent tentative settled cost report, whichever is from the latest cost reporting period.</P>
          <P>(3) For discharges occurring on or after August 8, 2003, the fiscal intermediary may use a statewide average cost-to-charge ratio if it is unable to determine an accurate operating or capital cost-to-charge ratio for a hospital in one of the following circumstances:</P>
          <P>(i) New hospitals that have not yet submitted their first Medicare cost report. (For this purpose, a new hospital is defined as an entity that has not accepted assignment of an existing hospital's provider agreement in accordance with § 489.18 of this chapter.)</P>
          <P>(ii) Hospitals whose operating or capital cost-to-charge ratio is in excess of 3 standard deviations above the corresponding national geometric mean. This mean is recalculated annually by CMS and published in the annual notice of prospective payment rates issued in accordance with § 412.8(b).</P>
          <P>(iii) Other hospitals for whom the fiscal intermediary obtains accurate data with which to calculate either an operating or capital cost-to-charge ratio (or both) are not available.</P>
          <P>(4) For discharges occurring on or after August 8, 2003, any reconciliation of outlier payments will be based on operating and capital cost-to-charge ratios calculated based on a ratio of costs to charges computed from the relevant cost report and charge data determined at the time the cost report coinciding with the discharge is settled.</P>
          <P>(j) If any of the services are determined to be noncovered, the charges for these services will be deducted from the requested amount of reimbursement but not to exceed the amount claimed above the cost outlier threshold.</P>

          <P>(k) Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, the additional amount is derived by first taking 80 percent of the difference between the hospital's adjusted operating cost for the discharge (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section) and the operating threshold criteria established under § 412.80(a)(1)(ii); 80 percent <PRTPAGE P="623"/>is also taken of the difference between the hospital's adjusted capital cost for the discharge (as determined under paragraph (g) of this section) and the capital threshold criteria established under § 412.80(a)(1)(ii). The resulting capital amount is then multiplied by the applicable Federal portion of the payment as determined in § 412.340(a) or § 412.344(a).</P>
          <P>(l) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988, the additional payment amount for the DRGs related to burn cases, which are identified in the most recent annual notice of prospective payment rates published in accordance with § 412.8(b), is computed under the provisions of paragraph (k) of this section except that the payment is made using 90 percent of the difference between the hospital's adjusted cost for the discharge and the threshold criteria.</P>
          <P>(m) Effective for discharges occurring on or after August 8, 2003, at the time of any reconciliation under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, outlier payments may be adjusted to account for the time value of any underpayments or overpayments. Any adjustment will be based upon a widely available index to be established in advance by the Secretary, and will be applied from the midpoint of the cost reporting period to the date of reconciliation.</P>

          <P>(A) Clinical trials;</P>
          <P>(B) Peer reviewed journal articles;</P>
          <P>(C) Study results;</P>
          <P>(D) Meta-analyses;</P>
          <P>(E) Consensus statements;</P>
          <P>(F) White papers;</P>
          <P>(G) Patient surveys;</P>
          <P>(H) Case studies;</P>
          <P>(I) Reports;</P>
          <P>(J) Systematic literature reviews;</P>
          <P>(K) Letters from major healthcare associations;</P>
          <P>(L) Editorials and letters to the editor; and,</P>
          <P>(M) Public comments.</P>
          <P>(N) Other appropriate information sources may be considered.</P>
          <P>(iv) The medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new medical service or technology may have a low prevalence among Medicare beneficiaries.</P>
          <P>(v) The new medical service or technology may represent an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of a subpopulation of patients with the medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new medical service or technology.</P>
          <P>(2) A medical service or technology may be considered new within 2 or 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the inpatient hospital code (as defined in section 1886(d)(5)(K)(iii) of the Social Security Act) assigned to the new service or technology (depending on when a new code is assigned and data on the new service or technology become available for DRG recalibration). After CMS has recalibrated the DRGs, based on available data, to reflect the costs of an otherwise new medical service or technology, the medical service or technology will no longer be considered “new” under the criterion of this section.</P>

          <P>(3) The DRG prospective payment rate otherwise applicable to discharges involving the medical service or technology is determined to be inadequate, based on application of a threshold amount to estimated charges incurred with respect to such discharges. To determine whether the payment would be adequate, CMS will determine whether the charges of the cases involving a new medical service or technology will exceed a threshold amount that is the lesser of 75 percent of the standardized amount (increased to reflect the difference between cost and charges) or 75 percent of one standard deviation beyond the geometric mean standardized charge for all cases in the DRG to <PRTPAGE P="625"/>which the new medical service or technology is assigned (or the case-weighted average of all relevant DRGs if the new medical service or technology occurs in many different DRGs). Standardized charges reflect the actual charges of a case adjusted by the prospective payment system payment factors applicable to an individual hospital, such as the wage index, the indirect medical education adjustment factor, and the disproportionate share adjustment factor.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility criteria for alternative pathway for certain transformative new devices.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2020, CMS provides for additional payments (as specified in § 412.88) beyond the standard DRG payments and outlier payments to a hospital for discharges involving covered inpatient hospital services that are new medical devices, if the following conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(1) A new medical device has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing authorization and is part of the FDA's Breakthrough Devices Program.</P>
          <P>(2) A medical device that meets the condition in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be considered new for not less than 2 years and not more than 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the inpatient hospital code (as defined in section 1886(d)(5)(K)(iii) of the Social Security Act) assigned to the new technology (depending on when a new code is assigned and data on the new technology become available for DRG recalibration). After CMS has recalibrated the DRGs, based on available data, to reflect the costs of an otherwise new medical technology, the medical technology will no longer be considered “new” under the criterion of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The new medical device meets the conditions described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligibility criteria for alternative pathway for Qualified Infectious Disease Products.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2020, CMS provides for additional payments (as specified in § 412.88) beyond the standard DRG payments and outlier payments to a hospital for discharges involving covered inpatient hospital services that are new medical products, if the following conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(1) A new medical product has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing authorization and is designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product by the FDA.</P>
          <P>(2) A medical product that meets the condition in paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be considered new for not less than 2 years and not more than 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the inpatient hospital code (as defined in section 1886(d)(5)(K)(iii) of the Social Security Act) assigned to the new technology (depending on when a new code is assigned and data on the new technology become available for DRG recalibration). After CMS has recalibrated the DRGs, based on available data, to reflect the costs of an otherwise new medical technology, the medical technology will no longer be considered “new” under the criterion of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The new medical product meets the conditions described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Announcement of determinations and deadline for consideration of new medical service or technology applications.</E> (1) CMS will consider whether a new medical service or technology meets the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section and announce the results in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as part of its annual updates and changes to the IPPS. CMS will only consider any particular new medical service or technology for add-on payments under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) CMS will only consider, for add-on payments for a particular fiscal year, an application for which the new medical service or technology has received FDA approval or clearance by July 1 prior to the particular fiscal year.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special treatment: Sole community hospitals.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria for classification as a sole community hospital.</E> CMS classifies a hospital as a sole community hospital if it is located more than 35 miles from other like hospitals, or it is located in a rural area (as defined in § 412.64) and meets one of the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(1) The hospital is located between 25 and 35 miles from other like hospitals and meets one of the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) No more than 25 percent of residents who become hospital inpatients or no more than 25 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who become hospital inpatients in the hospital's service area are admitted to other like hospitals located within a 35-mile radius of the hospital, or, if larger, within its service area;</P>
        <P>(ii) The hospital has fewer than 50 beds and the MAC certifies that the hospital would have met the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section were it not for the fact that some beneficiaries or residents were forced to seek care outside the service area due to the unavailability of necessary specialty services at the community hospital; or</P>
        <P>(iii) Because of local topography or periods of prolonged severe weather conditions, the other like hospitals are inaccessible for at least 30 days in each 2 out of 3 years.</P>
        <P>(2) The hospital is located between 15 and 25 miles from other like hospitals but because of local topography or periods of prolonged severe weather conditions, the other like hospitals are inaccessible for at least 30 days in each 2 out of 3 years.</P>
        <P>(3) Because of distance, posted speed limits, and predictable weather conditions, the travel time between the hospital and the nearest like hospital is at least 45 minutes.</P>
        <P>(4) For a hospital with a main campus and one or more remote locations under a single provider agreement where services are provided and billed under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and that meets the provider-based criteria at § 413.65 of this chapter as a main campus and a remote location of a hospital, combined data from the main campus and its remote location(s) are required to demonstrate that the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are met. For the mileage and rural location criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the mileage, accessibility, and travel time criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, the hospital must demonstrate that the main campus and its remote location(s) each independently satisfy those requirements.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Classification procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request for classification as sole community hospital.</E> (i) The hospital must make its request to its MAC.</P>
        <P>(ii) If a hospital is seeking sole community hospital classification under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the hospital must include the following information with its request:</P>
        <P>(A) The hospital must provide patient origin data (for example, the number of patients from each zip code from which the hospital draws inpatients) for all inpatient discharges to document the boundaries of its service area.</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital must provide patient origin data from all other hospitals located within a 35 mile radius of it or, if larger, within its service area, to document that no more than 25 percent of either all of the population or the Medicare beneficiaries residing in the hospital's service area and hospitalized for inpatient care were admitted to other like hospitals for care.</P>
        <P>(iii)(A) If the hospital is unable to obtain the information required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section concerning the residences of Medicare beneficiaries who were inpatients in other hospitals located within a 35 mile radius of the hospital or, if larger, within the hospital's service area, the hospital may request that CMS provide this information.</P>

        <P>(B) If a hospital obtains the information as requested under paragraph <PRTPAGE P="629"/>(b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, that information is used by both the MAC and CMS in making the determination of the residences of Medicare beneficiaries under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section, regardless of any other information concerning the residences of Medicare beneficiaries submitted by the hospital.</P>
        <P>(iv) The MAC reviews the request and send the request, with its recommendation, to CMS.</P>
        <P>(v) CMS reviews the request and the MAC's recommendation and forward its approval or disapproval to the MAC.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective dates of classification.</E>(i) For applications received on or before September 30, 2018, sole community hospital status is effective 30 days after the date of CMS' written notification of approval, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. For applications received on or after October 1, 2018, sole community hospital status is effective as of the date the MAC receives the complete application, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. </P>
        <P>(ii) When a court order or a determination by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) reverses a CMS denial of sole community hospital status and no further appeal is made, the sole community hospital status is effective as follows:</P>
        <P>(A) If the hospital's application was submitted prior to October 1, 1983, its status as a sole community hospital is effective at the start of the cost reporting period for which it sought exemption from the cost limits.</P>
        <P>(B) If the hospital's application for sole community hospital status was received on or after October 1, 1983 and on or before September 30, 2018, the effective date is 30 days after the date of CMS' original written notification of denial.</P>
        <P>(C) If the hospital's application for sole community hospital status was received on or after October 1, 2018, the effective date is the date the MAC receives the complete application.</P>
        <P>(iii) When a hospital is granted retroactive approval of sole community hospital status by a court order or a PRRB decision and the hospital wishes its sole community hospital status terminated before the date of the court order or PRRB determination, it must submit written notice to the CMS regional office within 90 days of the court order or PRRB decision. A written request received after the 90-day period is effective no later than 30 days after the request is submitted.</P>
        <P>(iv) For applications received on or before September 30, 2018, a hospital classified as a sole community hospital receives a payment adjustment, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, effective with discharges occurring on or after 30 days after the date of CMS' approval of the classification. For applications received on or after October 1, 2018, a hospital classified as a sole community hospital receives a payment adjustment, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, effective with discharges occurring on or after the date the MAC receives the complete application.</P>
        <P>(v) If a hospital that is classified as an MDH under § 412.108 applies for classification as a sole community hospital because its status under the MDH program expires with the expiration of the MDH program, and that hospital's sole community hospital status is approved, the effective date of approval of sole community hospital status is the day following the expiration date of the MDH program if the hospital—</P>
        <P>(A) Applies for classification as a sole community hospital prior to 30 days before the expiration of the MDH program; and</P>
        <P>(B) Requests that sole community hospital status be effective with the expiration of the MDH program.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Duration of classification.</E> (i) An approved classification as a sole community hospital remains in effect without need for reapproval unless there is a change in the circumstances under which the classification was approved. An approved sole community hospital must notify the MAC if any change that is specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section occurs. If CMS determines that a sole community hospital failed to comply with this requirement, CMS will cancel the hospital's classification as a sole community hospital effective with the date that the hospital no longer met the criteria for such classification, consistent with the provisions of § 405.1885 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="630"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) A sole community hospital must report the following to the MAC within 30 days of the event:</P>
        <P>(A) The opening of a new hospital in its service area.</P>
        <P>(B) The opening of a new road between itself and a like provider within 35 miles.</P>
        <P>(C) An increase in the number of beds to more than 50 if the hospital qualifies as a sole community hospital under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(D) Its geographic classification changes.</P>
        <P>(E) Any changes to the driving conditions that result in a decrease in the amount of travel time between itself and a like provider if the hospital qualifies as a sole community hospital under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) A sole community hospital must report to the MAC if it becomes aware of any change that would affect its classification as a sole community hospital beyond the events listed in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days of the event. If CMS determines that a sole community hospital has failed to comply with this requirement, CMS will cancel the hospital's classification as a sole community hospital effective with the date the hospital became aware of the event that resulted in the sole community hospital no longer meeting the criteria for such classification, consistent with the provisions of § 405.1885 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(iv) A sole community hospital must report to the MAC any factor or information that could have affected its initial classification as a sole community hospital.</P>
        <P>(A) If CMS determines that a sole community hospital has failed to comply with the requirement of paragraph ((b)(3)(iv) of this section, CMS may cancel the hospital's classification as a sole community hospital effective with the date the hospital failed to meet the criteria for such classification, consistent with the provisions of § 405.1885 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(B) Effective on or after October 1, 2012, if a hospital reports to CMS any factor or information that could have affected its initial determination and CMS determines that the hospital should not have qualified for sole community hospital status, CMS will cancel the sole community hospital status effective 30 days from the date of the determination.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Cancellation of classification.</E> (i) A hospital may at any time request cancellation of its classification as a sole community hospital, and be paid at rates determined under subparts D and E of this part, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>(ii) The cancellation becomes effective no later than 30 days after the date the hospital submits its request.</P>
        <P>(iii) If a hospital requests that its sole community hospital classification be cancelled, it may not be reclassified as a sole community hospital unless it meets the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(A) At least one full year has passed since the effective date of its cancellation.</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital meets the qualifying criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section in effect at the time it reapplies.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Automatic classification as a sole community hospital.</E> A hospital that has been granted an exemption from the hospital cost limits before October 1, 1983, or whose request for the exemption was received by the appropriate intermediary before October 1, 1983, and was subsequently approved, is automatically classified as a sole community hospital unless that classification has been cancelled under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or there is a change in the circumstances under which the classification was approved.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Terminology.</E> As used in this section—</P>
        <P>(1) The term <E T="03">miles</E> means the shortest distance in miles measured over improved roads. An improved road for this purpose is any road that is maintained by a local, State, or Federal government entity and is available for use by the general public. An improved road includes the paved surface up to the front entrance of the hospital.</P>
        <P>(2) The term <E T="03">like hospital</E> means a hospital furnishing short-term, acute care. Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, for purposes of a hospital seeking sole community hospital designation, CMS will not consider the nearby hospital to be a like hospital if the total inpatient days attributable to units of the nearby hospital that provides a <PRTPAGE P="631"/>level of care characteristic of the level of care payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system are less than or equal to 8 percent of the similarly calculated total inpatient days of the hospital seeking sole community hospital designation.</P>
        <P>(3) The term <E T="03">service area</E> means the area from which a hospital draws at least 75 percent of its inpatients during the most recent 12-month cost reporting period ending before it applies for classification as a sole community hospital.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Determining prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs for sole community hospitals</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 1990, a sole community hospital is paid based on whichever of the following amounts yields the greatest aggregate payment for the cost reporting period:</P>
        <P>(i) The Federal payment rate applicable to the hospitals as determined under subpart D of this part.</P>
        <P>(ii) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.73.</P>
        <P>(iii) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.75.</P>
        <P>(iv) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2000, the hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.77 (calculated under the transition schedule set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</P>
        <P>(v) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, the hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.78.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Transition of FY 1996 hospital-specific rate.</E> The MAC calculates the hospital-specific rate determined on the basis of the fiscal year 1996 base period rate as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For Federal fiscal year 2001, the hospital-specific rate is the sum of 75 percent of the greater of the amounts specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), or (d)(1)(iii) of this section, plus 25 percent of the hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.77.</P>
        <P>(ii) For Federal fiscal year 2002, the hospital-specific rate is the sum of 50 percent of the greater of the amounts specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), or (d)(1)(iii) of this section, plus 50 percent of the hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.77.</P>
        <P>(iii) For Federal fiscal year 2003, the hospital-specific rate is the sum of 25 percent of the greater of the amounts specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), or (d)(1)(iii) of this section, plus 75 percent of the hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.77.</P>
        <P>(iv) For Federal fiscal year 2004 and any subsequent fiscal years, the hospital-specific rate is 100 percent of the hospital-specific rate specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjustment to payments.</E> A sole community hospital may receive an adjustment to its payments to take into account a significant decrease in the number of discharges, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional payments to sole community hospitals experiencing a significant volume decrease.</E> (1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983, the MAC provides for a payment adjustment for a sole community hospital for any cost reporting period during which the hospital experiences, due to circumstances as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section a more than five percent decrease in its total discharges of inpatients as compared to its immediately preceding cost reporting period. If either the cost reporting period in question or the immediately preceding cost reporting period is other than a 12-month cost reporting period, the MAC must convert the discharges to a monthly figure and multiply this figure by 12 to estimate the total number of discharges for a 12-month cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(2) To qualify for a payment adjustment on the basis of a decrease in discharges, a sole community hospital must submit its request no later than 180 days after the date on the MAC's Notice of Amount of Program Reimbursement—</P>
        <P>(i) Submit to the MAC documentation demonstrating the size of the decrease in discharges, and the resulting effect on per discharge costs; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Show that the decrease is due to circumstances beyond the hospital's control.</P>

        <P>(3) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 2017, <PRTPAGE P="632"/>the MAC determines a lump sum adjustment amount not to exceed the difference between the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs and the hospital's total DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs (including outlier payments for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional payments made for inpatient operating costs for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients as determined under § 412.106 and for indirect medical education costs as determined under § 412.105). Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2017, the MAC determines a lump sum adjustment amount equal to the difference between the hospital's fixed Medicare inpatient operating costs and the hospital's total MS-DRG revenue based on MS-DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs (including outlier payments for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional payments made for inpatient operating costs for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients as determined under § 412.106 and for indirect medical education costs as determined under § 412.105) multiplied by the ratio of the hospital's fixed inpatient operating costs to its total inpatient operating costs.</P>
        <P>(i) In determining the adjustment amount, the MAC considers—</P>
        <P>(A) The individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies;</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs, other than those costs paid on a reasonable cost basis under part 413 of this chapter; and</P>
        <P>(C) The length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in utilization.</P>
        <P>(ii) The MAC makes its determination within 180 days from the date it receives the hospital's request and all other necessary information.</P>
        <P>(iii) The MAC determination is subject to review under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special treatment: Referral centers.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria for classification as a referral center: Basic rule.</E> CMS classifies a hospital as a referral center only if the hospital is a Medicare participating acute care hospital and meets the applicable criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983.</E> The hospital meets either of the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(1) The hospital is located in a rural area (as defined in subpart D of this part) and has the following number of beds, as determined under the provisions of § 412.105(b) available for use:</P>
        <P>(i) Effective for discharges occurring before April 1, 1988, the hospital has 500 or more beds.</P>
        <P>(ii) Effective for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988, the hospital has 275 or more beds during its most recently completed cost reporting period unless the hospital submits written documentation with its application that its bed count has changed since the close of its most recently completed cost reporting period for one or more of the following reasons:</P>
        <P>(A) Merger of two or more hospitals.</P>
        <P>(B) Reopening of acute care beds previously closed for renovation.</P>
        <P>(C) Transfer to the prospective payment system of acute care beds previously classified as part of an excluded unit.</P>
        <P>(D) Expansion of acute care beds available for use and permanently maintained for lodging inpatients, excluding beds in corridors and other temporary beds.</P>

        <P>(2) The hospital shows that—(i) At least 50 percent of its Medicare patients are referred from other hospitals or from physicians not on the staff of the hospital; and<PRTPAGE P="633"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) At least 60 percent of the hospital's Medicare patients live more than 25 miles from the hospital, and at least 60 percent of all the services that the hospital furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries are furnished to beneficiaries who live more than 25 miles from the hospital.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative criteria.</E> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985, a hospital that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section is classified as a referral center if it is located in a rural area (as defined in subpart D of this part) and meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and at least one of the three criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Case-mix index.</E> CMS sets forth national and regional case-mix index values in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates published under § 412.8(b). The methodology CMS uses to calculate these criteria is described in paragraph (h) of this section. The case-mix index value to be used for an individual hospital in the determination of whether it meets the case-mix index criteria is that calculated by CMS from the hospital's own billing records for Medicare discharges as processed by the fiscal intermediary and submitted to CMS. The hospital's case-mix index for discharges (not including discharges from units excluded from the prospective payment system under subpart B of this part) during the most recent Federal fiscal year that ended at least one year prior to the beginning of the cost reporting period for which the hospital is seeking referral center status must be at least equal to—</P>
        <P>(i) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before October 1, 1986, the national or regional case-mix index value; or</P>
        <P>(ii) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost—reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, the national case-mix index value as established by CMS or the median case-mix index value for urban hospitals located in each region. In calculating the median case-mix index for each region, CMS excludes the case-mix indexes of hospitals receiving indirect medical education payments as provided in § 412.105.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Number of discharges.</E> (i) CMS sets forth the national and regional number of discharges in each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates published under § 412.8(b). The methodology CMS uses to calculate these criteria is described in paragraph (i) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for an osteopathic hospital, for the hospital's cost reporting period that began during the same fiscal year as the cost reporting periods used to compute the regional median discharges under paragraph (i) of this section, its number of discharges (not including discharges from units excluded from the prospective payments system under subpart B of this part or from newborn units) is at least equal to—</P>
        <P>(A) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1985 and before October 1, 1986, the number of discharges under either the national or regional criterion; or</P>
        <P>(B) For hospitals applying for rural referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1986, 5,000 discharges or, if less, the median number of discharges for urban hospitals located in each region.</P>
        <P>(ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1986, an osteopathic hospital, recognized by the American Osteopathic Healthcare Association (or any successor organization), that is located in a rural area must have at least 3,000 discharges during its cost reporting period that began during the same fiscal year as the cost reporting periods used to compute the regional median discharges under paragraph (i) of this section to meet the number of discharges criterion.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Medical staff.</E> More than 50 percent of the hospital's active medical staff are specialists who meet one of the following conditions:</P>

        <P>(i) Are certified as specialists by one of the Member Boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties or the Advisory Board of Osteopathic Specialists.<PRTPAGE P="634"/>
        </P>
        <P>(ii) Have completed the current training requirements for admission to the certification examination of one of the Member Boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties or the Advisory Board of Osteopathic Specialists.</P>
        <P>(iii) Have successfully completed a residency program in a medical specialty accredited by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Source of inpatients.</E> At least 60 percent of all its discharges are for inpatients who reside more than 25 miles from the hospital.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Volume of referrals.</E> At least 40 percent of all inpatients treated at the hospital are referred from other hospitals or from physicians not on the hospital's staff.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Criteria for hospitals that have remote location(s).</E> For a hospital with a main campus and one or more remote locations under a single provider agreement where services are provided and billed under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and that meets the provider-based criteria at § 413.65 of this chapter as a main campus and a remote location of a hospital, combined data from the main campus and its remote location(s) are required to demonstrate that the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) and (c)(1) through (5) of this section are met. For the rural location criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section and the mileage criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (c)(4) of this section, the hospital must demonstrate that the main campus and its remote locations each independently satisfy those requirements.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment to rural referral centers.</E> Effective for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1994, a hospital that is located in a rural area and meets the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (c) of this section is paid prospective payments for inpatient operating costs per discharge based on the applicable other urban payment rates as determined in accordance with § 412.63, as adjusted by the hospital's area wage index.</P>
        <P>(f) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Hospital cancellation of referral center status.</E> (1) A hospital may at any time request cancellation of its status as a referral center and be paid prospective payments per discharge based on the applicable rural rate, as determined in accordance with subpart D of this part.</P>
        <P>(2) The cancellation becomes effective no later than 30 days after the date the hospital submits its request.</P>
        <P>(3) If a hospital requests that its referral center status be canceled, it may not be reclassified as a referral center unless it meets the qualifying criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section in effect at the time it reapplies.</P>
        <P>(4) A hospital that submits a written request on or after October 1, 2007, to cancel its reclassification under § 412.103(g) is deemed to have cancelled its status as a rural referral center effective on the same date the cancellation under § 412.103(g) takes effect. The provision of this paragraph (g)(4) applies to hospitals that qualify as rural referral centers under § 412.96 based on rural status acquired under § 412.103.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Methodology for calculating case-mix index criteria.</E> CMS calculates the national and regional case-mix index value criteria as described in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(4) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Updating process.</E> CMS updates the national and regional case-mix index standards using the latest available data from hospitals subject to the prospective payment system for the Federal fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Source of data.</E> In making the calculations described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, CMS uses all inpatient hospital bills received for discharges subject to prospective payment during the Federal fiscal year being monitored.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> CMS sets forth the national and regional criteria in the annual notice of prospective payment rates published under § 412.8(b). These criteria are used to determine if a hospital qualifies for referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1 of the Federal fiscal year to which the notice applies.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Methodology for calculating number of discharges criteria.</E> For purposes of <PRTPAGE P="635"/>determining compliance with the national or regional number of discharges criterion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, CMS calculates the criteria as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Updating process.</E> CMS updates the national and regional number of discharges using the latest available data for levels of admissions or discharges or both.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Source of data.</E> In making the calculations described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, CMS uses the most recent hospital admissions or discharge data available.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Annual notice.</E> CMS sets forth the national and regional criteria in the annual notice of prospective payment rates published under § 412.8(b). These criteria are compared to an applying hospital's number of discharges for the same cost reporting period used to develop the regional criteria in this section in determining if the hospital qualifies for referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1 of the Federal fiscal year to which the notice applies.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Adjustments for renal transplantation centers.</E> (1) CMS adjusts the prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs determined under subparts D and E of this part for hospitals approved as renal transplantation centers (described at §§ 405.2170 and 405.2171 of this chapter) to remove the estimated net expenses associated with kidney acquisition.</P>
        <P>(2) Kidney acquisition costs are treated apart from the prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs, and payment to the hospital is adjusted in each reporting period to reflect an amount necessary to compensate the hospital for reasonable expenses of kidney acquisition.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Costs of kidney acquisition.</E> Expenses recognized under this section include costs of acquiring a kidney, from a live donor or a cadaver, irrespective of whether the kidney was obtained by the hospital or through an organ procurement agency. These costs include—</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special treatment: Inpatient hospital payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> Beginning in FY 2011, the terms used in this section are defined as follows:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Medicare discharges</E> means discharge of inpatients entitled to Medicare Part A, including discharges associated with individuals whose inpatient benefits are exhausted or whose stay was not covered by Medicare and also discharges of individuals enrolled in a MA organization under Medicare Part C.<PRTPAGE P="636"/>
        </P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Road miles</E> means “miles” as defined in § 412.92(c)(1).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">General considerations.</E> (1) CMS provides an additional payment to a qualifying hospital for the higher incremental costs associated with a low volume of discharges. The amount of any additional payment for a qualifying hospital is calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) In order to qualify for this adjustment, a hospital must meet the following criteria, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:</P>
        <P>(i) For FY 2005 through FY 2010 and FY 2023 and subsequent fiscal years, a hospital must have fewer than 200 total discharges, which includes Medicare and non-Medicare discharges, during the fiscal year, based on the hospital's most recently submitted cost report, and be located more than 25 road miles (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) from the nearest “subsection (d)” (section 1886(d) of the Act) hospital.</P>
        <P>(ii) For FY 2011 through FY 2018, a hospital must have fewer than 1,600 Medicare discharges, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, during the fiscal year, based on the hospital's Medicare discharges from the most recently available MedPAR data as determined by CMS, and be located more than 15 road miles, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, from the nearest “subsection (d)” (section 1886(d) of the Act) hospital.</P>
        <P>(iii) For FY 2019 through FY 2022, a hospital must have fewer than 3,800 total discharges, which includes Medicare and non-Medicare discharges, during the fiscal year, based on the hospital's most recently submitted cost report, and be located more than 15 road miles (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) from the nearest “subsection (d)” (section 1886(d) of the Act) hospital.</P>
        <P>(3) In order to qualify for the adjustment, a hospital must provide its fiscal intermediary or Medicare administrative contractor with sufficient evidence that it meets the distance requirement specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The fiscal intermediary or Medicare administrative contractor will base its determination of whether the distance requirement is satisfied upon the evidence presented by the hospital and other relevant evidence, such as maps, mapping software, and inquiries to State and local police, transportation officials, or other government officials.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of the adjustment amount.</E> The low-volume adjustment for hospitals that qualify under paragraph (b) of this section is as follows for the applicable fiscal year:</P>
        <P>(1) For FY 2005 through FY 2010 and FY 2023 and subsequent fiscal years, the adjustment is an additional 25 percent for each Medicare discharge.</P>
        <P>(2) For FY 2011 through FY 2018, the adjustment is as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For low-volume hospitals with 200 or fewer Medicare discharges (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section), the adjustment is an additional 25 percent for each Medicare discharge.</P>
        <P>(ii) For low-volume hospitals with Medicare discharges (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) of more than 200 and fewer than 1,600, the adjustment for each Medicare discharge is an additional percent calculated using the formula [(4/14)—(number of Medicare discharges/5600)]. The “number of Medicare discharges” is determined as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) For FY 2019 through FY 2022, the adjustment is as follows:</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special treatment: Hospitals that incur indirect costs for graduate medical education programs.</SUBJECT>
        <P>CMS makes an additional payment to hospitals for indirect medical education costs using the following procedures:</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic data.</E> CMS determines the following for each hospital:</P>
        <P>(1) The hospital's ratio of full-time equivalent residents (except as limited under paragraph (f) of this section) to the number of beds (as determined under paragraph (b) of this section).</P>

        <P>(i) Except for the special circumstances for Medicare GME affiliated groups, emergency Medicare GME affiliated groups, and new programs described in paragraphs (f)(1)(vi) and (f)(1)(vii) of this section for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, and for the special circumstances for closed hospitals or closed programs described in paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, this ratio may not exceed the ratio for the hospital's most recent prior cost reporting period after accounting for the cap on the number of allopathic and osteopathic full-time <PRTPAGE P="641"/>equivalent residents as described in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, and adding to the capped numerator any dental and podiatric full-time equivalent residents.</P>
        <P>(ii)(A) For new programs started prior to October 1, 2012, the exception for new programs described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section applies to each new program individually for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted based on the period of years equal to the minimum accredited length of each new program.</P>
        <P>(B) For new programs started on or after October 1, 2012, the exception for new programs described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section applies to each new program individually during the cost reporting periods prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the first new program started, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(1) of this chapter, and prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the each individual new program started, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(3) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(iii) The exception for closed hospitals and closed programs described in paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section applies only through the end of the first 12-month cost reporting period in which the receiving hospital trains the displaced full-time equivalent residents.</P>
        <P>(iv) In the cost reporting period following the last year the receiving hospital's full-time equivalent cap is adjusted for the displaced resident(s), the resident-to-bed ratio cap in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is calculated as if the displaced full-time equivalent residents had not trained at the receiving hospital in the prior year.</P>
        <P>(2) The hospital's DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs, excluding outlier payments for inpatient operating costs determined under subpart F of this part and additional payments made under the provisions of § 412.106.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of the number of beds.</E> For purposes of this section, the number of beds in a hospital is determined by counting the number of available bed days during the cost reporting period and dividing that number by the number of days in the cost reporting period. This count of available bed days excludes bed days associated with—</P>
        <P>(1) Beds in a unit or ward that is not occupied to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system at any time during the 3 preceding months (the beds in the unit or ward are to be excluded from the determination of available bed days during the current month);</P>
        <P>(2) Beds in a unit or ward that is otherwise occupied (to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system) that could not be made available for inpatient occupancy within 24 hours for 30 consecutive days;</P>
        <P>(3) Beds in excluded distinct part hospital units;</P>
        <P>(4) Beds otherwise countable under this section used for outpatient observation services, skilled nursing swing-bed services, or inpatient hospice services.</P>
        <P>(5) Beds or bassinets in the healthy newborn nursery; and</P>
        <P>(6) Custodial care beds.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Measurement for teaching activity.</E> The factor representing the effect of teaching activity on inpatient operating costs equals .405 for discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of education adjustment factor.</E> Each hospital's education adjustment factor is calculated as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Step one.</E> A factor representing the sum of 1.00 plus the hospital's ratio of full-time equivalent residents to beds, as determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is raised to an exponential power equal to the factor set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Step two.</E> The factor derived from step one is reduced by 1.00.<PRTPAGE P="642"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Step three.</E> The factor derived from completing steps one and two is multiplied by “c”, and where “c” is equal to the following:</P>
        <P>(i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, and before October 1, 1997, 1.89.</P>
        <P>(ii) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 1998, 1.72.</P>
        <P>(iii) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 1999, 1.6.</P>
        <P>(iv) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2000, 1.47.</P>
        <P>(A) Each hospital receives an amount that is equal in the aggregate to the difference between the amount of payments made to the hospital if “c” equaled 1.6, rather than 1.47.</P>
        <P>(B) The payment of this amount will not affect any other payments, determinations, or budget neutrality adjustments.</P>
        <P>(v) For fiscal year 2001—</P>
        <P>(A) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2000 and before April 1, 2001, 1.54.</P>
        <P>(B) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001 and before October 1, 2001, the adjustment factor is determined as if “c” equaled 1.66, rather than 1.54. This payment increase will not apply to discharges occurring after fiscal year 2001 and will not be taken into account in calculating the payment amounts applicable for discharges occurring after fiscal year 2001.</P>
        <P>(vi) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2002, 1.6.</P>
        <P>(vii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2002 and before April 1, 2004, 1.35.</P>
        <P>(viii) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2004 and before October 1, 2004, 1.47.</P>
        <P>(ix) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2005, 1.42.</P>
        <P>(x) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2006, 1.37.</P>
        <P>(xi) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2007, 1.32.</P>
        <P>(xii) For discharges occurring during fiscal year 2008 and thereafter, 1.35.</P>
        <P>(4) For discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2005, with respect to FTE residents added as a result of increases in the FTE resident cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, the factor derived from completing steps one and two is multiplied by ‘c’, where ‘c’ is equal to 0.66.</P>
        <P>(e)(1) <E T="03">Determination of payment amount.</E> Each hospital's indirect medical education payment under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs is determined by multiplying the total DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs, as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, by the applicable education adjustment factor derived in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) For discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2005, a hospital that counts additional residents as a result of an increase in its FTE resident cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) of this section will receive indirect medical education payments based on the sum of the following two indirect medical education adjustment factors:</P>
        <P>(i) An adjustment factor that is calculated using the schedule of formula multipliers in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and the hospital's FTE resident count, not including residents attributable to an increase in its FTE cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) under this section; and</P>
        <P>(ii) An adjustment factor that is calculated using the applicable formula multiplier under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and the additional number of FTE residents that are attributable to the increase in the hospital's FTE resident cap under paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(C) in this section.</P>

        <P>(iii)(A) Full-time equivalent status is based on the total time necessary to fill a residency slot. No individual may be counted as more than one full-time equivalent. If a resident is assigned to more than one hospital, the resident counts as a partial full-time equivalent based on the proportion of time worked in any areas of the hospital listed in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section to the total time worked by the resident. A hospital cannot claim the time spent by residents training at another hospital. A part-time resident or one working in an area of the hospital other than those listed under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section (such as a freestanding family practice center or an excluded hospital unit) would be counted as a partial full-time equivalent based on the proportion of time assigned to an area of the hospital listed in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, compared to the total time necessary to fill a full-time residency slot.</P>
        <P>(B) The time spent by a resident in research that is not associated with the treatment or diagnosis of a particular patient is not countable.</P>
        <P>(C) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1983, except for research activities described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the time a resident is training in an approved medical residency program in a hospital setting, as described in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(A) through (f)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, must be spent in either patient care activities, as defined in § 413.75(b) of this subchapter, or in nonpatient care activities, such as didactic conferences and seminars, to be counted. This provision may not be applied in a manner that would require the reopening of settled cost reports, except those cost reports on which, as of March 23, 2010, there is a jurisdictionally proper appeal pending on direct GME or IME payments.</P>

        <P>(D) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 1983, the time spent by a resident in an approved medical residency program on vacation, sick leave, or other approved leave that does not prolong the total time the resident is participating in the approved program beyond the normal duration of the program is countable. This provision may not be applied in a manner that would require the reopening of settled cost reports, except those cost reports on which, as of March 23, 2010, there is a jurisdictionally proper appeal pending on direct GME or IME payments.<PRTPAGE P="644"/>

Effective October 1, 2014, if a rural hospital is redesignated as urban due to the most recent OMB standards for delineating statistical areas adopted by CMS, the redesignated urban hospital may retain any existing increases to its FTE resident cap that it had received prior to when the redesignation became effective. Effective October 1, 2014, if a rural hospital is redesignated as urban due to the most recent OMB standards for delineating statistical areas adopted by CMS, the redesignated urban hospital may receive an increase to its FTE resident cap for a new program, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, if it received a letter of accreditation for the new program and/or started training residents in the new program prior to the redesignation becoming effective.</P>
        <P>(v)(A) For a hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 1998, the total number of full-time equivalent residents for payment purposes is equal to the average of the actual full-time equivalent resident counts (subject to the requirements listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(C) and (f)(1)(iv) of this section) for that cost reporting period and the preceding cost reporting period.</P>

        <P>(B) For a hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1998, the total number of full-time equivalent residents for payment purposes is equal to the average of the actual full-time equivalent resident count (subject to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(C) and (f)(1)(iv) of this section) for that cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods.<PRTPAGE P="645"/>
        </P>
        <P>(C) For new programs started prior to October 1, 2012, if a hospital qualified for an adjustment to the limit established under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section for new medical residency programs created under paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section, the count of residents participating in new medical residency training programs above the number included in the hospital's full-time equivalent count for the cost reporting period ending during calendar year 1996 is added after applying the averaging rules in paragraph (f)(1)(v)(B) of this section for a period of years. Residents participating in new medical residency training programs are included in the hospital's full-time equivalent count before applying the averaging rules after the period of years has expired. For purposes of this paragraph, for each new program started, the period of years equals the minimum accredited length for each new program. The period of years for each new program begins when the first resident begins training in each new program.</P>
        <P>(D) For new programs started on or after October 1, 2012, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e) of this chapter, full-time equivalent residents participating in new medical residency training programs are excluded from the hospital's full-time equivalent count before applying the averaging rules during the cost reporting periods prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the first new program started, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(1) of this chapter, and prior to the beginning of the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the each individual new program started, for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(3) of this chapter. Beginning with the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of the first new program started for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(1) of this chapter, and beginning with the applicable hospital's cost reporting period that coincides with or follows the start of the sixth program year of each individual new program started for hospitals for which the full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with § 413.79(e)(3) of this chapter, full-time equivalent residents participating in new medical residency training programs are included in the hospital's full-time equivalent count before applying the averaging rules in paragraph (f)(1)(v)(B) of this section.</P>
        <P>(E) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section, full-time equivalent residents that are displaced by the closure of either another hospital or another hospital's program are added to the full-time equivalent count after applying the averaging rules in paragraph (f)(1)(v)(B) of this section for the receiving hospital for the duration of time that the displaced residents are training at the receiving hospital.</P>
        <P>(F) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(1)(x) of this section, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2000, full-time equivalent residents at an urban hospital in a rural track program are included in the urban hospital's rolling average calculation described in this paragraph (f)(1)(v)(B).</P>
        <P>(vi) Hospitals that are part of the same Medicare GME affiliated group or emergency Medicare GME affiliated group (as defined in § 413.75(b) of this subchapter) may elect to apply the limit specified in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section on an aggregate basis, as specified in § 413.79(f) of this subchapter. Effective beginning on or after October 1, 2008, home and host hospitals with valid emergency Medicare GME affiliation agreements are exempt from the application of the ratio cap specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</P>

        <P>(vii) If a hospital establishes a new medical residency training program, as defined in § 413.79(l) of this subchapter, the hospital's full-time equivalent cap may be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of § 413.79(e) of this subchapter.<PRTPAGE P="646"/>
        </P>
        <P>(viii) A hospital that began construction of its facility prior to August 5, 1997, and sponsored new medical residency training programs on or after January 1, 1995 and on or before August 5, 1997, that either received initial accreditation by the appropriate accrediting body or temporarily trained residents at another hospital(s) until the facility was completed, may receive an adjustment to its full-time equivalent cap in accordance with the provisions of § 413.79(g) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(ix)(A) A hospital may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE resident cap to reflect residents added because of another hospital's closure if the hospital meets the criteria specified in §§ 413.79(h)(1) and (h)(2) of this subchapter. If a hospital that closes its residency training program agrees to temporarily reduce its FTE resident cap according to the criteria specified in §§ 413.79(h)(1) and (h)(3)(ii) of this subchapter, another hospital(s) may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE resident cap to reflect residents added because of the closure of the residency training program if the criteria specified in §§ 413.79(h)(1) and (h)(3)(i) of this subchapter are met.</P>
        <P>(B) A hospital may receive a permanent adjustment to its FTE resident cap as a result of slots that were redistributed from a closed hospital, as defined at § 413.79(h)(1)(i) of this subchapter, if the hospital meets the requirements at § 413.79(o) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(x) An urban hospital that establishes a new residency program (as defined in § 413.79(l) of this subchapter), or has an existing residency program, with a rural track (or an integrated rural track) may include in its FTE count residents in those rural tracks in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 413.79(k) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(xi) Effective for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning on or after November 29, 1999, a hospital may receive an adjustment to its FTE cap of up to three additional FTEs to the extent that the additional residents would have been counted as primary care residents for purposes of the hospital's FTE cap but for the fact that the additional residents were on maternity or disability leave or a similar approved leave of absence, in accordance with the provisions of § 413.79(i) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(xii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, a non-Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap to reflect residents who had been previously trained at a VA hospital and were subsequently transferred to the non-VA hospital, if the hospital meets the criteria and other provisions of § 413.79(j) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(xiii) For a hospital that was paid under part 413 of this chapter as a hospital excluded from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and that subsequently becomes subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, the limit on the total number of FTE residents for payment purposes is determined based on the data from the hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.</P>
        <P>(xiv) In the case of a merger of a hospital that is excluded from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and an acute care hospital subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, if the surviving hospital is a hospital subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and no hospital unit that is excluded from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system is created as a result of the merger, the surviving hospital's number of FTE residents for payment purposes is equal to the sum of the FTE resident count of the hospital that is subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section and the limit on the total number of FTE residents for the excluded hospital as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(xiii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(xv) Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, an urban hospital that reclassifies to a rural area under § 412.103 for fewer than 10 continuous years and then subsequently elects to revert back to urban classification will not be allowed to retain the adjustment to its IME FTE resident cap that it received as a result of being reclassified as rural.</P>

        <P>(2) To include a resident in the full-time equivalent count for a particular <PRTPAGE P="647"/>cost reporting period, the hospital must furnish the following information. The information must be certified by an official of the hospital and, if different, an official responsible for administering the residency program.</P>
        <P>(i) A listing, by specialty, of all residents assigned to the hospital and providing services to the hospital during the cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(ii) The name and social security number of each resident.</P>
        <P>(iii) The dates the resident is assigned to the hospital.</P>
        <P>(iv) The dates the resident is assigned to other hospitals or other freestanding providers and any nonprovider setting during the cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(v) The proportion of the total time necessary to fill a residency slot that the resident is assigned to an area of the hospital listed under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) Fiscal intermediaries must verify the correct count of residents.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Indirect medical education payment for managed care enrollees.</E> For portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after January 1, 1998, a payment is made to a hospital for indirect medical education costs, as determined under paragraph (e) of this section, for discharges associated with individuals who are enrolled under a risk-sharing contract with an eligible organization under section 1876 of the Act or with a Medicare + Choice organization under title XVIII, Part C of the Act during the period, according to the applicable payment percentages described in §§ 413.76(c)(1) through (c)(5) of this subchapter.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special treatment: Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General considerations.</E> (1) The factors considered in determining whether a hospital qualifies for a payment adjustment include the number of beds, the number of patient days, and the hospital's location.</P>
        <P>(i) The number of beds in a hospital is determined in accordance with § 412.105(b).</P>
        <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, the number of patient days in a hospital includes only those days attributable to units or wards of the hospital providing acute care services generally payable under the prospective payment system and excludes patient days associated with—</P>
        <P>(A) Beds in excluded distinct part hospital units;</P>
        <P>(B) Beds otherwise countable under this section used for outpatient observation services, skilled nursing swing-bed services, or inpatient hospice services;</P>
        <P>(C) Beds in a unit or ward that is not occupied to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system at any time during the 3 preceding months (the beds in the unit or ward are to be excluded from the determination of available bed days during the current month); and</P>
        <P>(D) Beds in a unit or ward that is otherwise occupied (to provide a level of care that would be payable under the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system) that could not be made available for inpatient occupancy within 24 hours for 30 consecutive days.</P>
        <P>(iii) The hospital's location, in an urban or rural area, is determined in accordance with the definitions in § 412.64, except that a reclassification that results from an urban hospital reclassified as rural as set forth in § 412.103 is classified as rural.</P>
        <P>(2) The payment adjustment is applied to the hospital's DRG revenue for inpatient operating costs based on DRG-adjusted prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs, excluding outlier payments for inpatient operating costs under subpart F of this part and additional payments made under the provisions of § 412.105.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of a hospital's disproportionate patient percentage</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is determined by adding the results of two computations and expressing that sum as a percentage.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">First computation: Federal fiscal year.</E> For each month of the Federal <PRTPAGE P="648"/>fiscal year in which the hospital's cost reporting period begins, CMS—</P>
        <P>(i) Determines the number of patient days that—</P>
        <P>(A) Are associated with discharges occurring during each month; and</P>
        <P>(B) Are furnished to patients who during that month were entitled to both Medicare Part A (including Medicare Advantage (Part C)) and SSI, excluding those patients who received only State supplementation;</P>
        <P>(ii) Adds the results for the whole period; and</P>
        <P>(iii) Divides the number determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section by the total number of days that—</P>
        <P>(A) Are associated with discharges that occur during that period; and</P>
        <P>(B) Are furnished to patients entitled to Medicare Part A (including Medicare Advantage (Part C)).</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">First computation: Cost reporting period.</E> If a hospital prefers that CMS use its cost reporting period instead of the Federal fiscal year, it must furnish to CMS, through its intermediary, a written request including the hospital's name, provider number, and cost reporting period end date. This exception will be performed once per hospital per cost reporting period, and the resulting percentage becomes the hospital's official Medicare Part A/SSI percentage for that period.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Second computation.</E> The fiscal intermediary determines, for the same cost reporting period used for the first computation, the number of the hospital's patient days of service for which patients were eligible for Medicaid but not entitled to Medicare Part A, and divides that number by the total number of patient days in the same period. For purposes of this second computation, the following requirements apply:</P>
        <P>(i) For purposes of this computation, a patient is deemed eligible for Medicaid on a given day only if the patient is eligible for inpatient hospital services under an approved State Medicaid plan or under a waiver authorized under section 1115(a)(2) of the Act on that day, regardless of whether particular items or services were covered or paid under the State plan or the authorized waiver.</P>
        <P>(ii) Effective with discharges occurring on or after January 20, 2000, for purposes of counting days under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, hospitals may include all days attributable to populations eligible for Title XIX matching payments through a waiver approved under section 1115 of the Social Security Act.</P>
        <P>(iii) The hospital has the burden of furnishing data adequate to prove eligibility for each Medicaid patient day claimed under this paragraph, and of verifying with the State that a patient was eligible for Medicaid during each claimed patient hospital day.</P>
        <P>(iv) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2009, the hospital must report the days in the numerator of the fraction in the second computation in a cost reporting period based on the date of discharge, the date of admission, or the dates of service. If a hospital seeks to change its methodology for reporting days in the numerator of the fraction in the second computation, the hospital must notify CMS, through its fiscal intermediary or MAC, in writing at least 30 days before the beginning of the cost reporting period in which the change would apply. The written notification must specify the methodology the hospital will use, the cost reporting period to which the requested change would apply, and the current methodology being used. Such a change will be effective only on the first day of a cost reporting period. If a hospital changes its methodology for reporting such days, CMS or the fiscal intermediary or MAC may adjust the number of days reported for a cost reporting period if it determines that any of those days have been counted in a prior cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Disproportionate patient percentage.</E> The intermediary adds the results of the first computation made under either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section and the second computation made under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and expresses that sum as a percentage. This is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, and is used in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Criteria for classification.</E> A hospital is classified as a “disproportionate share” hospital under any of the following circumstances:<PRTPAGE P="649"/>
        </P>
        <P>(1) The hospital's disproportionate patient percentage, as determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, is at least equal to one of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) 15 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area, and has 100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area and has 500 or more beds.</P>
        <P>(ii) 30 percent for discharges occurring before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in a rural area and either has more than 100 beds and fewer than 500 beds or is classified as a sole community hospital under § 412.92.</P>
        <P>(iii) 40 percent for discharges before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has fewer than 100 beds.</P>
        <P>(iv) 45 percent for discharges before April 1, 2001, and 15 percent for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2001, if the hospital is located in a rural area and has 100 or fewer beds.</P>
        <P>(2) The hospital is located in an urban area, has 100 or more beds, and can demonstrate that, during its cost reporting period, more than 30 percent of its net inpatient care revenues are derived from State and local government payments for care furnished to indigent patients.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment adjustment factor</E>—(1) <E T="03">Method of adjustment.</E> Subject to the reduction factor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, if a hospital serves a disproportionate number of low-income patients, its DRG revenues for inpatient operating costs are increased by an adjustment factor as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment adjustment factors.</E> (i) If the hospital meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the payment adjustment factor is equal to one of the following:</P>
        <P>(A) If the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage is greater than 20.2 percent, the applicable payment adjustment factor is as follows:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and before January 1, 1991, 5.62 percent plus 65 percent of the difference between 20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1991, and before October 1, 1993, 5.62 percent plus 70 percent of the difference between 20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1994, 5.88 percent plus 80 percent of the difference between 20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, 5.88 percent plus 82.5 percent of the difference between 20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria for classification as a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital</E>—</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">General considerations.</E> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after April 1, 1990, and ending before October 1, 1994, or for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 2022, a hospital is classified as a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital if it meets all of the following conditions:</P>
        <P>(i) It is located in a rural area (as defined in subpart D of this part) or it is located in a State with no rural area and satisfies any of the criteria under § 412.103(a)(1) or (3) or under § 412.103(a)(2) as of January 1, 2018.</P>
        <P>(ii) The hospital has 100 or fewer beds as defined in § 412.105(b) during the cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(iii) The hospital is not also classified as a sole community hospital under § 412.92.</P>
        <P>(iv) At least 60 percent of the hospital's inpatient days or discharges were attributable to individuals entitled to Medicare Part A benefits during the hospital's cost reporting period or periods as follows, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section:</P>
        <P>(A) The hospital's cost reporting period ending on or after September 30, 1987 and before September 30, 1988.</P>
        <P>(B) If the hospital does not have a cost reporting period that meets the criterion set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the hospital's cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1986, and before October 1, 1987.</P>
        <P>(C) At least two of the last three most recent audited cost reporting periods for which the Secretary has a settled cost report.</P>
        <P>(v) If the cost reporting period determined under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section is for less than 12 months, the hospital's most recent 12-month or longer cost reporting period before the short period is used.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Counting days and discharges.</E> In counting inpatient days and discharges for purposes of meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, only days and discharges from acute care inpatient hospital stays are counted (including days and discharges from swing beds when used for acute care inpatient hospital services), but not including days and discharges from units excluded from the prospective payment system under §§ 412.25 through 412.30 or from newborn nursery units. For purposes of this section, a transfer as defined in § 412.4(b) is considered to be a discharge.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Criteria for hospitals that have remote location(s).</E> For a hospital with a main campus and one or more remote locations under a single provider agreement where services are provided and billed under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and that meets the provider-based criteria at <PRTPAGE P="655"/>§ 413.65 of this chapter as a main campus and a remote location of a hospital, combined data from the main campus and its remote location (s) are required to demonstrate that the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met. For the location requirement specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the hospital must demonstrate that the main campus and its remote locations each independently satisfy this requirement.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Classification procedures.</E> (1) The MAC determines whether a hospital meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) A hospital must submit a written request along with qualifying documentation to its fiscal intermediary to be considered for MDH status based on the criterion under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.</P>
        <P>(3) The MAC will make its determination and notify the hospital within 90 days from the date that it receives the hospital's request and all of the required documentation.</P>
        <P>(4) For applications received on or before September 30, 2018, a determination of MDH status made by the MAC is effective 30 days after the date the MAC provides written notification to the hospital. For applications received on or after October 1, 2018, a determination of MDH status made by the MAC is effective as of the date the MAC receives the complete application. An approved MDH status determination remains in effect unless there is a change in the circumstances under which the status was approved.</P>
        <P>(i) An approved MDH must notify the MAC if any change occurs that is specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section occurs. If CMS determines that an MDH failed to comply with this requirement, CMS will cancel the hospital's classification as an MDH effective with the date that the hospital no longer met the criteria for such status, consistent with the provisions of § 405.1885 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) An MDH must report the following to the MAC within 30 days of the event:</P>
        <P>(A) The number of beds increases to more than 100.</P>
        <P>(B) Its geographic classification changes.</P>
        <P>(iii) An MDH must report to the MAC if it becomes aware of any change that would affect its classification as an MDH beyond the events listed in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section within 30 days of the event. If CMS determines that an MDH has failed to comply with this requirement, CMS will cancel the hospital's classification as an MDH effective with the date the hospital became aware of the event that resulted in the MDH no longer meeting the criteria for such classification, consistent with the provisions of § 405.1885 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(5) The MAC will evaluate on an ongoing basis, whether or not a hospital continues to qualify for MDH status. This evaluation includes an ongoing review to ensure that the hospital continues to meet all of the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) If the MAC determines that a hospital no longer qualifies for MDH status, the change in status will become effective 30 days after the date the MAC provides written notification to the hospital.</P>
        <P>(7) A hospital may reapply for MDH status following its disqualification only after it has completed another cost reporting period that has been audited and settled. The hospital must reapply for MDH status in writing to its MAC and submit the required documentation.</P>
        <P>(8) If a hospital disagrees with an MAC's determination regarding the hospital's initial or ongoing MDH status, the hospital may notify its MAC and submit other documentable evidence to support its claim that it meets the MDH qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>(9) The MAC's initial and ongoing determination is subject to review under subpart R of Part 405 of this chapter. The time required by the MAC to review the request is considered good cause for granting an extension of the time limit for the hospital to apply for that review.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment methodology.</E> A hospital that meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section is paid for its inpatient operating costs the sum of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.</P>

        <P>(1) The Federal payment rate applicable to the hospital, as determined under subpart D of this part, subject to <PRTPAGE P="656"/>the regional floor defined in § 412.70(c)(6).</P>
        <P>(2) The amount, if any, determined as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For discharges occurring during the first three 12-month cost reporting periods that begin on or after April 1, 1990, 100 percent of the amount that the Federal rate determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is exceeded by the higher of the following:</P>
        <P>(A) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.73.</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.75.</P>
        <P>(ii) For discharges occurring during any subsequent cost reporting period (or portion thereof) and before October 1, 1994, and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 and before October 1, 2006, 50 percent of the amount that the Federal rate determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is exceeded by the higher of the following:</P>
        <P>(A) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.73.</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.75.</P>
        <P>(iii) For discharges occurring during cost reporting periods (or portions thereof) beginning on or after October 1, 2006, and before October 1, 2022, 75 percent of the amount that the Federal rate determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is exceeded by the highest of the following:</P>
        <P>(A) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.73.</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.75.</P>
        <P>(C) The hospital-specific rate as determined under § 412.79.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional payments to hospitals experiencing a significant volume decrease.</E> (1) CMS provides for a payment adjustment for a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital for any cost reporting period during which the hospital experiences, due to circumstances as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a more than 5 percent decrease in its total inpatient discharges as compared to its immediately preceding cost reporting period. If either the cost reporting period in question or the immediately preceding cost reporting period is other than a 12-month cost reporting period, the MAC must convert the discharges to a monthly figure and multiply this figure by 12 to estimate the total number of discharges for a 12-month cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(2) To qualify for a payment adjustment on the basis of a decrease in discharges, a Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital must submit its request no later than 180 days after the date on the MAC's Notice of Amount of Program Reimbursement and it must—</P>
        <P>(i) Submit to the MAC documentation demonstrating the size of the decrease in discharges and the resulting effect on per discharge costs; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Show that the decrease is due to circumstances beyond the hospital's control.</P>
        <P>(3) The MAC determines a lump sum adjustment amount in accordance with the methodology set forth in § 412.92(e)(3).</P>
        <P>(i) In determining the adjustment amount, the MAC considers—</P>
        <P>(A) The individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies;</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs, other than those costs paid on a reasonable cost basis under part 413 of this chapter; and</P>
        <P>(C) The length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in utilization.</P>
        <P>(ii) The MAC makes its determination within 180 days from the date it receives the hospital's request and all other necessary information.</P>
        <P>(iii) The MAC determination is subject to review under subpart R of part 405 of this chapter. The time required by the MAC to review the request is considered good cause for granting an extension of the time limit for the hospital to apply for that review.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> For payment purposes, CMS treats as a sole community hospital any hospital that is located in a rural area as described in paragraph (b) of this section and that CMS designated as an EACH under section 1820(i)(1) of the Act as in effect on September 30, 1997, for as long as the hospital continues to comply with the terms, conditions, and limitations that were applicable at the time CMS designated the hospital as an EACH. The payment methodology for sole community hospitals is set forth at § 412.92(d).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Location in a rural area.</E> For purposes of this section, a hospital is located in a rural area if it—</P>
        <P>(1) Is located outside any area that is a Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget or that has been recognized as urban under § 412.62;</P>
        <P>(2) Is not deemed to be located in an urban area under subpart D of this part.</P>
        <P>(3) Is not classified as an urban hospital for purposes of the standardized payment amount by CMS or the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board; or</P>
        <P>(4) Is not located in a rural county that has been redesignated to an adjacent urban area under § 412.232.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustment to the hospital-specific rate for rural EACH's experiencing increased costs</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> CMS increases the applicable hospital-specific rate of an EACH that it treats as a sole community hospital if, during a cost reporting period, the hospital experiences an increase in its Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge that is directly attributable to activities related to its membership in a rural health network.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Request and documentation.</E> In order for a hospital to qualify for an increase in its hospital-specific rate, it must meet the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) The hospital must submit its request to its intermediary no later than 180 days after the date on the intermediary's notice of program reimbursement.</P>
        <P>(ii) The request must include documentation specifically identifying the increased costs resulting from the hospital's participation in a rural health network and show that the increased costs during the cost reporting period will result in increased costs in subsequent cost reporting periods that are not already accounted for under the prospective payment system payment.</P>
        <P>(iii) The hospital must show that the cost increases are incremental costs that would not have been incurred in the absence of the hospital's membership in a rural health network.</P>
        <P>(iv) The hospital must show that the cost increases do not include amounts for start-up and one-time, nonrecurring costs attributable to its membership in a rural health network.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Intermediary recommendation.</E> The intermediary forwards the following material to CMS within 60 days of receipt from the hospital:</P>
        <P>(i) The hospital's documentation and the intermediary's verification of that documentation.</P>
        <P>(ii) The intermediary's analysis and recommendation of the request.</P>
        <P>(iii) The hospital's Medicare cost report for the year in which the increase in costs occurred and the prior year.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">CMS determination.</E> CMS determines, within 120 days of receiving all necessary information from the intermediary, whether an increase in the hospital-specific rate is warranted and, if it is, the amount of the increase. CMS grants an adjustment only if a hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge exceed the hospital's hospital-specific rate. The adjusted hospital-specific rate cannot exceed the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating costs per discharge for the cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of EACH designation.</E> If CMS determines that a hospital no longer complies with the terms, conditions, and limitations that were applicable at the time CMS designated the hospital as an EACH, CMS will terminate the EACH designation of the hospital, effective with discharges occurring on or after 30 days after the date of the determination.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Review of CMS determination.</E> A determination by CMS that a hospital's EACH designation should be terminated, is subject to review under part <PRTPAGE P="658"/>405, subpart R of this chapter, including the time limits for filing requests for hearings as specified in §§ 405.1811(a) and 405.1841(a)(1) and (b) of this chapter.</P>

        <P>(2)(i) For cost reporting periods, or any part of a cost reporting period, beginning on or after January 1, 1989, through any part of a cost reporting period occurring before January 1, 1990, payment is determined on a reasonable cost basis for anesthesia services provided in a hospital or CAH by qualified nonphysician anesthetists employed by the hospital or CAH or obtained under arrangement, if the hospital or CAH demonstrates to its intermediary prior to April 1, 1989 that it meets the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(A) The hospital or CAH is located in a rural area as defined in § 412.62(f) and is not deemed to be located in an urban area under the provisions of § 412.64(b)(3). Effective December 2, 2010, the hospital or CAH is either located in a rural area as defined at § 412.62(f) and is not deemed to be located in an urban area under the provisions of § 412.64(b)(3) or the hospital or CAH has reclassified as rural under the provisions at § 412.103.</P>
        <P>(B) The hospital or CAH must have employed or contracted with a qualified nonphysician anesthetist, as defined in § 410.69 of this chapter, as of January 1, 1988 to perform anesthesia services in that hospital or CAH. The hospital or CAH may employ or contract with more than one anesthetist; however, the total number of hours of service furnished by the anesthetists may not exceed 2,080 hours per year.</P>

        <P>(C) The hospital or CAH must provide data for its entire patient population to demonstrate that, during calendar year 1987, its volume of surgical procedures (inpatient and outpatient) requiring anesthesia services did not exceed 250 procedures. For purposes of this section, a <E T="03">surgical procedure requiring anesthesia services</E> means a surgical procedure in which the anesthesia is administered and monitored by a qualified nonphysician anesthetist, a physician other than the primary surgeon, or an intern or resident.</P>
        <P>(D) Each qualified nonphysician anesthetist employed by or under contract with the hospital or CAH has agreed in writing not to bill on a reasonable charge basis for his or her patient care to Medicare beneficiaries in that hospital or CAH.</P>
        <P>(ii) To maintain its eligibility for reasonable cost payment under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section in calendar years after 1989, a qualified hospital or CAH must demonstrate prior to January 1 of each respective year that for the prior year its volume of surgical procedures requiring anesthesia service did not exceed 500 procedures; or, effective October 1, 2002, did not exceed 800 procedures.</P>

        <P>(iii) A hospital or CAH that did not qualify for reasonable cost payment for nonphysician anesthetist services furnished in calendar year 1989 can qualify in subsequent years if it meets the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (D) of this section, and demonstrates to its intermediary prior to the start of the calendar year that it met these criteria. The hospital or CAH must provide data for its entire patient population to demonstrate that, during calendar year 1987 and the year immediately preceding its election of reasonable cost payment, its volume of <PRTPAGE P="660"/>surgical procedures (inpatient and outpatient) requiring anesthesia services did not exceed 500 procedures, or, effective October 1, 2002, did not exceed 800 procedures.</P>
        <P>(iv) For administrative purposes for the calendar years after 1990, the volume of surgical procedures for the immediately preceding year is the sum of the surgical procedures for the nine month period ending September 30, annualized for the twelve month period.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Organ acquisition.</E> Payment for organ acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved transplantation centers is made on a reasonable cost basis. The term “Organs” is defined in § 486.302 of this chapter.</P>

The hospital may continue to receive periodic interim payments until the intermediary meets the requirements of section 1816 (c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months. For purposes of this paragraph, a hospital that is receiving periodic interim payments as of June 30, 1987 and meets the requirements of § 413.64(h) of this chapter may continue to receive payment on this basis until the hospital's intermediary meets the requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months beginning with April 1987.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.</E> The hospital is receiving periodic interim payments as of June 30, 1987 and has a disproportionate share payment adjustment factor of at least 5.1 percent as determined under § 412.106(c) for purposes of establishing the average standardized amounts for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987. The hospital's request must be made by a date prior to July 1, 1987, specified by the intermediary.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Small rural hospitals.</E> The hospital is receiving periodic interim payments as of June 30, 1987, makes its request by a date prior to July 1, 1987, specified by the intermediary, and, on July 1, 1987, the hospital—</P>
        <P>(A) Is located in a rural area as defined in § 412.62(f); and</P>
        <P>(B) Has 100 or fewer beds available for use.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Frequency of payment.</E> The intermediary estimates a hospital's prospective payments as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount of payment for the year. Each payment is made two weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service, as described in § 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. These payments are subject to final settlement.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of payment.</E> (i) The biweekly interim payment amount is based on the total estimated Medicare discharges for the reporting period multiplied by the hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this paragraph. These interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if a hospital receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period.</P>
        <P>(ii) For purposes of determining periodic interim payments under this paragraph, a hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount is computed as follows:</P>
        <P>(A) If a hospital has no payment experience under the prospective payment system for operating costs, the intermediary computes the hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount for operating costs by multiplying its payment rates as determined under § 412.70(c), but without adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the hospital's case-mix index, and subtracting from this amount estimated deductibles and coinsurance.</P>
        <P>(B) Effective for cost-reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the intermediary computes a hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount for capital-related costs by multiplying its prospective payment rate as determined under § 412.340 or § 412.344(a), as applicable, and under § 412.308 for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001 but without adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the hospital's case-mix index. The intermediary may take into account estimated additional payments per discharge under § 412.348. If the hospital is paid under § 412.344(a)(1), the intermediary includes an estimated payment for old capital costs per discharge.</P>

        <P>(C) If a hospital has payment experience under the prospective payment system for operating costs, and, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, for inpatient capital-related costs, the intermediary <PRTPAGE P="662"/>computes a hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount for operating costs and capital-related costs based on that payment experience, adjusted for projected changes, and subtracts from this amount estimated deductibles and coinsurance.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Termination of periodic interim payments</E>—(i) <E T="03">Request by the hospital.</E> A hospital receiving periodic interim payments may convert to payments on a per discharge basis at any time.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Removal by the intermediary.</E> An intermediary terminates periodic interim payments if—</P>
        <P>(A) A hospital no longer meets the requirements of § 413.64(h);</P>
        <P>(B) A hospital is receiving payment under the criterion in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and the intemediary meets the prompt payment requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months; or</P>
        <P>(C) A hospital that is receiving payment under the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section no longer meets the criterion.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limitation on reelection.</E> If a hospital that is receiving periodic interim payments under the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii) of this section is removed from that method of payment at its own request, it may reelect to receive periodic interim payments only under the criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. However, if the hospital is removed from that method of payment by its intermediary because it no longer meets the requirements of § 413.64(h) of this chapter, that hospital may subsequently reelect to receive periodic interim payments if it qualifies under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii) of this section, subject to the requirements in § 413.64(h) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Special interim payments for certain costs.</E> For capital-related costs for cost-reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991 and the direct costs of medical education, which are not included in prospective payments but are reimbursed as specified in §§ 413.130 and 413.85 of this chapter, respectively, interim payments are made subject to final cost settlement. Interim payments for capital-related items for cost-reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991 and the estimated cost of approved medical education programs (applicable to inpatient costs payable under Medicare Part A and for kidney acquisition costs in hospitals approved as renal transplantation centers) are determined by estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the previous year's experience and on substantiated information for the current year and divided into 26 equal biweekly payments. Each payment is made two weeks after the end of a biweekly period of services, as described in § 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter. The interim payments are reviewed by the intermediary at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Special interim payment for unusually long lengths of stay</E>—(1) <E T="03">First interim payment.</E> A hospital that is not receiving periodic interim payments under paragraph (b) of this section may request an interim payment after a Medicare beneficiary has been in the hospital at least 60 days. Payment for the interim bill is determined as if the bill were a final discharge bill and includes any outlier payment determined as of the last day for which services have been billed.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional interim payments.</E> A hospital may request additional interim payments at intervals of at least 60 days after the date of the first interim bill submitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Payment for these additional interim bills, as well as the final bill, is determined as if the bill were the final bill with appropriate adjustments made to the payment amount to reflect any previous interim payment made under the provisions of this paragraph (d).</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Outlier payment and additional payments for new medical services and technologies.</E> Payments for outlier cases and additional payments for new medical services and technologies (described in subpart F of this part) are not made on an interim basis.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Accelerated payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Upon request, an accelerated payment may be made to a hospital that is <PRTPAGE P="663"/>not receiving periodic interim payments under paragraph (b) of this section if the hospital is experiencing financial difficulties because of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) There is a delay by the intermediary in making payment to the hospital.</P>
        <P>(ii) Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in the hospital's preparation and submittal of bills to the intermediary beyond its normal billing cycle.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Approval of payment.</E> A hospital's request for an accelerated payment must be approved by the intermediary and CMS.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of payment.</E> The amount of the accelerated payment is computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid covered services.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Recovery of payment.</E> Recovery of the accelerated payment is made by recoupment as hospital bills are processed or by direct payment by the hospital.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Puerto Rico rates for Federal fiscal year 1988.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> CMS determines the Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each inpatient hospital discharge occurring in Federal fiscal year 1988 for a prospective payment hospital. These rates are determined as described in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining target amounts.</E> For each hospital subject to the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs, CMS determines the Medicare target amount, as described in § 413.40(c) of this chapter, for the hospital's cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987. Revisions in the target amounts made subsequent to establishment of the standardized amounts under paragraph (d) of this section do not affect the standardized amounts.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Updating the target amounts for fiscal year 1988.</E> CMS updates each target amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section for fiscal year 1988 by prorating the applicable percentage increase (as defined in § 412.63(f) of this chapter) for fiscal year 1988 to the midpoint of fiscal year 1988 (April 1, 1988).</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Standardizing amounts.</E> CMS standardizes the amount updated under paragraph (c) of this section for each hospital by—</P>
        <P>(1) Adjusting for variations in case mix among hospitals;</P>
        <P>(2) Excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs;</P>
        <P>(3) Adjusting for area variations in hospital wage levels; and</P>
        <P>(4) Excluding an estimate of the payments for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Computing urban and rural averages.</E> CMS computes separate discharge-weighted averages of the standardized amounts determined under paragraph (d) of this section for urban and rural hospitals in Puerto Rico.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Geographic classification.</E> (1) For purposes of this paragraph (e) of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
        <P>(i) The term <E T="03">urban area</E> means a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget.</P>
        <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">large urban area</E> means an MSA with a population of more than 1,000,000.</P>
        <P>(iii) The term <E T="03">rural area</E> means any area outside an urban area.<PRTPAGE P="677"/>
        </P>
        <P>(2) A hospital classified as rural is deemed to be urban and receives the urban Puerto Rico payment amount if the county in which it is located meets the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) At least 95 percent of the perimeter of the rural county is contiguous with urban counties.</P>
        <P>(ii) The county was reclassified from an urban area to a rural area after April 20, 1983, as described in § 412.62(f)(1)(iv).</P>
        <P>(iii) At least 15 percent of employed workers in the county commute to the central county of one of the adjacent MSAs.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Reducing for value of outlier payments.</E> CMS reduces each of the average standardized amounts determined under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by CMS) of the total amount of payments based on DRG prospective payment rates that are additional payments to hospitals located in Puerto Rico for outlier cases under subpart F of this part.</P>
        <P>(h) <E T="03">Computing Puerto Rico rates established under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating costs for urban and rural hospitals.</E> For each discharge classified within a DRG, CMS establishes a Puerto Rico prospective payment rate, as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) For hospitals located in an urban area, the rate equals the product of—</P>
        <P>(i) The average standardized amount (computed under paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section) for hospitals located in an urban area; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The weighting factor determined under § 412.60(b) for that DRG.</P>
        <P>(2) For hospitals located in a rural area, the rate equals the product of—</P>
        <P>(i) The average standardized amount (computed under paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section) for hospitals located in a rural area; and</P>
        <P>(ii) The weighting factor determined under § 412.60(b) for that DRG.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Adjusting for different area wage levels.</E> CMS adjusts the proportion (as estimated by CMS from time to time) of Puerto Rico rates computed under paragraph (h) of this section that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs, for area differences in hospital wage levels, by a factor (established by CMS) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section) of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) CMS determines the Puerto Rico adjusted prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each inpatient hospital discharge occurring in Federal fiscal years 1989 through 2003 that involves inpatient hospital services of a hospital in Puerto Rico subject to the prospective payment system for which payment may be made under Medicare Part A.</P>
        <P>(2) The rate is determined for hospitals located in large urban, other urban, or rural areas within Puerto Rico, as described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Geographic classifications.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the definitions set forth in § 412.208(f)(1) apply.</P>
        <P>(2) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, a hospital located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount for the urban area to which the greatest number of workers in the county commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs if the commuting rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or central counties of all adjacent MSAs.</P>

        <FP>These EOMB standards are set forth in the notice of final standards for classification of MSAs published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 3, 1980 (45 FR 956), and available from CMS, East High Rise Building, Room 132, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207.</FP>

        <P>(3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, for hospitals that <PRTPAGE P="678"/>consist of two or more separately located inpatient hospital facilities, the national adjusted prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs is based on the geographic location of the hospital at which the discharge occurs.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Updating previous standardized amounts.</E> CMS computes separate average standardized amounts for hospitals in large urban, other urban, and rural areas within Puerto Rico equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for fiscal year 1988 under § 412.208(e)—</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> CMS determines the Puerto Rico adjusted prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs for each inpatient hospital discharge occurring in Federal fiscal year 2004 and subsequent fiscal years that involves inpatient hospital services of a hospital in Puerto Rico subject to the prospective payment system for which payment may be made under Medicare Part A.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Geographic classifications.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
        <P>(i) The term <E T="03">urban area</E> means a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as defined by the Executive Office of Management and Budget.</P>
        <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">rural area</E> means any area outside of an urban area.</P>

        <P>(2) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, a hospital located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas is deemed to be located in an urban area and receives the Federal payment amount for the urban area to which the greater number of workers in the county commute if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an urban area, under the standards for designating MSAs if the commuting rates used in determining outlying counties were determined on the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or central counties of all adjacent MSAs. These EOMB standards are set forth in the notice of final revised standards for classification of MSAs published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on December 27, 2000 (65 FR 82228), announced by EOMB on June 6, 2003, and available from <PRTPAGE P="679"/>CMS, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21244.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Computing the standardized amount.</E> CMS computes a Puerto Rico standardized amount that is applicable to all hospitals located in all areas. The applicable percentage change for updating the Puerto Rico specific standardized amount is as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) For fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2009, increased by the applicable percentage change specified in § 412.64(d)(1)(ii)(A).</P>
        <P>(2) For fiscal year 2010, increased by the market basket index for prospective payment hospitals (as defined in § 413.40(a) of this subchapter) for hospitals in all areas.</P>
        <P>(3) For fiscal year 2011, increased by the applicable percentage change specified in § 412.64(d)(1)(iii).</P>
        <P>(4) For fiscal year 2012 and subsequent fiscal years, the applicable percentage increase specified in § 412.64(d).</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Computing Puerto Rico Federal rates for inpatient operating costs for hospitals located in all areas.</E> For each discharge classified within a DRG, CMS establishes for the fiscal year a Puerto Rico prospective payment rate for inpatient operating costs equal to the product of—</P>
        <P>(1) The average standardized amount for the fiscal year for hospitals located in all areas; and</P>
        <P>(2) The weighting factor determined under § 412.60(b) for that DRG.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Adjusting for different area wage levels.</E> CMS adjusts the proportion of the Puerto Rico rate for inpatient operating costs that are attributable to wages and labor-related costs for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by CMS based on survey data) reflecting the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs in the geographic area (that is, urban or rural area as determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) of the hospital compared to the Puerto Rico average level of hospital wages and wage-related costs. The adjustment specified in this paragraph (e) also takes into account the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category.</P>
        <P>(1) The wage index is updated annually.</P>

        <P>(2) CMS determines the proportion of the Puerto Rico rate that is attributable to wages and labor-related costs from time to time, employing a methodology that is described in the annual update of the prospective payment system for payment of inpatient hospital operating costs published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
        </P>
        <P>(3) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS employs 62 percent as the proportion of the rate that is adjusted for the relative level of hospital wages and wage-related costs, unless employing that percentage would result in lower payments for the hospital than employing the proportion determined under the methodology described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Adjusting the wage index to account for commuting patterns of hospital workers</E>—(1) <E T="03">General criteria.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004, CMS adjusts the hospital wage index for hospitals located in qualifying areas to recognize the commuting patterns of hospital employees. A qualifying area is an area that meets all of the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(i) Hospital employees in the area commute to work in an MSA (or MSAs) with a wage index (or wage indices) higher than the wage index of the area.</P>
        <P>(ii) At least 10 percent of the county's hospital employees commute to an MSA (or MSAs) with a higher wage index (or wage indices).</P>
        <P>(iii) The 3-year average hourly wage of the hospital(s) in the area equals or exceeds the 3-year average hourly wage of all hospitals in the MSA or rural area in which the county is located.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Amount of adjustment.</E> A hospital located in an area that meets the criteria under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section will receive an increase in its wage index that is equal to a weighted average of the difference between the prereclassified wage index of the MSA (or MSAs) with the higher wage index (or wage indices) and the prereclasssified wage index of the qualifying area, weighted by the overall percentage of the hospital employees residing in the qualifying area who are employed in any MSA with a higher wage index.<PRTPAGE P="680"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Process for determining the adjustment.</E> (i) CMS will use the most accurate data available, as determined by CMS, to determine the out-migration percentage for each area.</P>
        <P>(ii) CMS will include, in its annual proposed and final notices of updates to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system, a listing of qualifying areas and the hospitals that are eligible to receive the adjustment to their wage indexes for commuting hospital employees, and the wage index increase applicable to each qualifying area.</P>

        <P>(iii) Any wage index adjustment made under this paragraph (f) is effective for a period of 3 fiscal years, except that hospitals in a qualifying county may elect to waive the application of the wage index adjustment. A hospital may waive the application of the wage index adjustment by notifying CMS in writing within 45 days of the date of public display of the annual notice of proposed rulemaking for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system at the Office of the <E T="02">Federal Register.</E>
        </P>
        <P>(iv) A hospital in a qualifying area that receives a wage index adjustment under this paragraph (f) is not eligible for reclassification under Subpart L of this part.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for an individual hospital seeking redesignation to another rural area or an urban area.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>—(1) <E T="03">Purposes.</E> Except as specified in paragraph (a)(5)—</P>

          <P>(i) For fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2005, an individual hospital may be redesignated from a rural area to an <PRTPAGE P="681"/>urban area, from a rural area to another rural area, or from an urban area to another urban area for the purposes of using the other area's standardized amount for inpatient operating costs, the wage index value, or both.</P>
          <P>(ii) Effective for fiscal year 2005 and subsequent fiscal years, an individual hospital may be redesignated from an urban area to another urban area, from a rural area to another rural area, or from a rural area to another urban area for the purposes of using the other area's wage index value.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Proximity.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to be redesignated to another rural area or an urban area, a hospital must demonstrate a close proximity to the area to which it seeks redesignation by meeting the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, and submitting data requested under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Special rules for sole community hospitals and rural referral centers.</E> To be redesignated under the special rules in this paragraph, a hospital must be approved as a sole community hospital or a rural referral center as of the date of the MGCRB's review.</P>
          <P>(i) A hospital that is approved as a rural referral center or a sole community hospital, or both, does not have to demonstrate a close proximity to the area to which it seeks redesignation.</P>
          <P>(ii) If a hospital that is approved as a rural referral center or a sole community hospital, or both, qualifies for urban redesignation, it is redesignated to the urban area that is closest to the hospital or to the hospital's geographic home area. If the hospital is closer to another rural area than to any urban area, it may seek redesignation to either the closest rural area or the closest urban area.</P>
          <P>(iii) If a sole community hospital or rural referral center loses its special status as a result of redesignation, the hospital is considered to retain its special status for the purpose of applicability of the special rules in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(iv) A hospital that is redesignated under paragraph (a)(3) of this section may not be redesignated in the same fiscal year under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Application of criteria.</E> In applying the numeric criteria contained in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) and (d)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section, rounding of numbers to meet the mileage or qualifying percentage standards is not permitted.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Limitations on redesignation.</E> The following limitations apply to redesignation:</P>
          <P>(i) An individual hospital may not be redesignated to another area for purposes of the wage index if the pre-reclassified average hourly wage for that area is lower than the pre-reclassified average hourly wage for the area in which the hospital is located.</P>
          <P>(ii) A hospital may not be redesignated to more than one area, except for an urban hospital that has been granted redesignation as rural under § 412.103 and receives an additional reclassification by the MGCRB.</P>
          <P>(iii) Beginning with wage index reclassification applications for FY 2003, if a hospital is already reclassified to a given geographic area for wage index purposes for a 3-year period, and submits an application for reclassification to the same area for either the second or third year of the 3-year period, that application will not be approved.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Proximity criteria.</E> A hospital demonstrates a close proximity with the area to which it seeks redesignation if one of the following conditions applies:</P>
          <P>(1) The distance from the hospital to the area is no more than 15 miles for an urban hospital and no more than 35 miles for a rural hospital.</P>
          <P>(2) At least 50 percent of the hospital's employees reside in the area.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Appropriate proximity data.</E> For redesignation to an area, the hospital must submit appropriate data relating to its proximity to that area.</P>
          <P>(1) To demonstrate proximity to the area, the hospital must submit evidence of the shortest route over improved roads to the area and the distance of that route.</P>
          <P>(2) For employee address data, the hospital must submit current payroll records that include information that establishes the home addresses by zip code of its employees.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of urban or other rural area's wage index</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria for use of area's wage index.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="682"/>to use an area's wage index, a hospital must demonstrate the following:</P>
          <P>(i) The hospital's incurred wage costs are comparable to hospital wage costs in an urban or other rural area;</P>
          <P>(ii) The hospital has the necessary geographic relationship as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;</P>
          <P>(iii) One of the following conditions apply:</P>
          <P>(A) With respect to redesignations for Federal fiscal years 1994 through 2001, the hospital's average hourly wage is at least 108 percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area in which the hospital is located;</P>
          <P>(B) With respect to redesignations for Federal fiscal years 2002 through 2005, the hospital's average hourly wage is, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area, at least 106 percent and in the case of a hospital located in an urban area, at least 108 percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area in which the hospital is located; or</P>
          <P>(C) With respect to redesignations for Federal fiscal year 2006 and subsequent years, the hospital's average hourly wage is, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area, at least 106 percent and in the case of a hospital located in an urban area, at least 108 percent of the average hourly wage of all other hospitals in the area in which the hospital is located;</P>
          <P>(iv) One of the following conditions apply:</P>
          <P>(A) For redesignations effective before fiscal year 1999, the hospital's average hourly wage weighted for occupational categories is at least 90 percent of the average hourly wages of hospitals in the area to which it seeks redesignation.</P>
          <P>(B) With respect to redesignations for fiscal year 1994 through 2001, the hospital's average hourly wage is equal to at least 84 percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area to which it seeks redesignation.</P>
          <P>(C) With respect to redesignations for fiscal years 2002 through 2009, the hospital's average hourly wage is equal to, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area, at least 82 percent, and in the case of a hospital located in an urban area, at least 84 percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area to which it seeks redesignation.</P>
          <P>(D) With respect to redesignations for fiscal year 2010, the hospital's average hourly wage is equal to, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area, at least 84 percent, and in the case of a hospital located in an urban area, at least 86 percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area to which it seeks redesignation.</P>
          <P>(E) With respect to redesignations for fiscal year 2011 and later fiscal years, the hospital's average hourly wage is equal to, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area, at least 82 percent, and in the case of a hospital located in an urban area, at least 84 percent of the average hourly wage of hospitals in the area to which it seeks redesignation.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Appropriate wage data.</E> For a wage index change, the hospital must submit appropriate wage data as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) For redesignations effective through FY 2002:</P>
          <P>(A) For hospital-specific data, the hospital must provide data from the CMS hospital wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect for prospective payment purposes during the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the hospital requests reclassification.</P>
          <P>(B) For data for other hospitals, the hospital must provide data concerning the average hourly wage in the area in which the hospital is located and the average hourly wage in the area to which the hospital seeks reclassification. The wage data are taken from the CMS hospital wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect for prospective payment purposes during the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which the hospital requests reclassification.</P>
          <P>(ii) For redesignations effective beginning FY 2003:</P>

          <P>(A) For hospital-specific data, the hospital must provide a weighted 3-year average of its average hourly wages using data from the CMS hospital wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect for prospective payment purposes. However, for the limited purpose of qualifying for geographic reclassification based on wage <PRTPAGE P="683"/>data from cost reporting periods beginning prior to FY 2000, a hospital may request that its wage data be revised if the hospital is in an urban area that was subject to the rural floor for the period during which the wage data the hospital wishes to revise were used to calculate its wage index.</P>
          <P>(B) For data for other hospitals, the hospital must provide a weighted 3-year average of the average hourly wage in the area in which the hospital is located and a weighted 3-year average of the average hourly wage in the area to which the hospital seeks reclassification. The wage data are taken from the CMS hospital wage survey used to construct the wage index in effect for prospective payment purposes.</P>
          <P>(iii) For applications submitted for reclassifications effective in FYs 2006 through 2008, a campus of a multicampus hospital may seek reclassification only to a CBSA in which another campus(es) is located. If the campus is seeking reclassification to a CBSA in which another campus(es) is located, as part of its reclassification request, the requesting entity must submit the composite wage data for the entire multicampus hospital as its hospital-specific data.</P>
          <P>(iv) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), if a new owner does not accept assignment of the existing hospital's provider agreement in accordance with § 489.18 of this chapter, the hospital will be treated as a new provider with a new provider number. In this case, the wage data associated with the previous hospital's provider number cannot be used in calculating the new hospital's 3-year average hourly wage. Once a new hospital has accumulated at least 1 year of wage data, it is eligible to apply for reclassification on the basis of those data.</P>
          <P>(v) For applications submitted for reclassification effective in FY 2009 and thereafter, a campus of a multicampus hospital that is located in a geographic area different from the area associated with the provider number of the entire multicampus hospital may seek reclassification to another CBSA using the composite wage data of the entire multicampus hospital as its hospital-specific data.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Rural referral center exceptions.</E> (i) If a hospital was ever approved as a rural referral center, it does not have to demonstrate that it meets the average hourly wage criterion set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(ii) If a hospital was ever approved as a rural referral center, it is required to meet only the criterion that applies to rural hospitals under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, regardless of its actual location in an urban or rural area.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Special dominating hospital exception.</E> The requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if a hospital meets the following criteria:</P>
          <P>(i) Its average hourly wage is at least 108 percent of the average hourly wage of all other hospitals in the area in which the hospital is located.</P>
          <P>(ii) It pays at least 40 percent of the adjusted uninflated wages in the MSA.</P>
          <P>(iii) It was approved for redesignation under this paragraph (d) for each year from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1997.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Single hospital MSA exception.</E> The requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if a hospital is the single hospital in its MSA with published 3-year average hourly wage data included in the current fiscal year inpatient prospective payment system final rule.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Withdrawing an application, terminating an approved 3-year reclassification, or canceling a previous withdrawal or termination.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Termination</E> refers to the termination of an already existing 3-year MGCRB reclassification where such reclassification has already been in effect for 1 or 2 years, and there are 1 or 2 years remaining on the 3-year reclassification. A termination is effective only for the full fiscal year(s) remaining in the 3-year period at the time the request is received. Requests for terminations for part of a fiscal year are not considered.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Withdrawal</E> refers to the withdrawal of a 3-year MGCRB reclassification that has not yet gone into effect or where the MGCRB has not yet issued a decision on the application.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The MGCRB allows a hospital, or group of hospitals, to withdraw its application or to terminate an already existing 3-year reclassification, in accordance with this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing.</E> (1) A request for withdrawal must be received by the MGCRB—</P>
          <P>(i) At any time before the MGCRB issues a decision on the application; or</P>

          <P>(ii) After the MGCRB issues a decision, provided that the request for withdrawal is received by the MCGRB within 45 days of the date that CMS' annual notice of proposed rulemaking is issued in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> concerning changes to the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and proposed payment rates for the fiscal year for which the application has been filed.</P>

          <P>(2) A request for termination must be received by the MGCRB within 45 days of the date that CMS' annual notice of proposed rulemaking is issued in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> concerning changes to the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and proposed payment rates for the fiscal year for which the termination is to apply.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Reapplication within the approved 3-year period, cancellations of terminations and withdrawals, and prohibition on overlapping reclassification approvals</E>—(1) <E T="03">Cancellation of terminations or withdrawals.</E> Subject to the provisions of this section, a hospital (or group of hospitals) may cancel a withdrawal or termination in a subsequent year and request the MGCRB to reinstate the wage index reclassification for the remaining fiscal year(s) of the 3-year period. (Withdrawals may be cancelled only in cases where the MGCRB issued a decision on the geographic reclassification request.)</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing and process of cancellation request.</E> Cancellation requests must be received in writing by the MGCRB no later than the deadline for submitting reclassification applications for the following fiscal year, as specified in § 412.256(a)(2).<PRTPAGE P="691"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Reapplications.</E> A hospital may apply for reclassification to a different area (that is, an area different from the one to which it was originally reclassified for the 3-year period). If the application is approved, the reclassification will be effective for 3 years. Once a 3-year reclassification becomes effective, a hospital may no longer cancel a withdrawal or termination of another 3-year reclassification, regardless of whether the withdrawal or termination request is made within 3 years from the date of the withdrawal or termination.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Termination of existing 3-year reclassification.</E> In a case in which a hospital with an existing 3-year wage index reclassification applies to be reclassified to another area, its existing 3-year reclassification will be terminated when a second 3-year wage index reclassification goes into effect for payments for discharges on or after the following October 1.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Written request only.</E> A request to withdraw an application must be made in writing to the MGCRB by all hospitals that are party to the application. A request to terminate an approved reclassification must be made in writing to the MGCRB by an individual hospital or by an individual hospital that is party to a group classification.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeal of the MGCRB's denial of a hospital's request for withdrawal or termination, or for cancellation of a withdrawal or termination.</E> (1) A hospital may file an appeal of the MGCRB's denial of its request for withdrawal or termination, or of the MGCRB's denial of its request for a cancellation of such withdrawal or termination, to the Administrator. The appeal must be received within 15 days of the date of the notice of the denial.</P>
          <P>(2) Within 20 days of receipt of the hospital's request for appeal, the Administrator affirms or reverses the denial.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for hospital's request for review.</E> (1) The hospital's request for review must be in writing and sent to the Administrator, in care of the Office of the Attorney Advisor. The request must be received by the Administrator within 15 days after the date the MGCRB issues its decision. A request for Administrator review filed by facsimile (FAX) or other electronic means will not be accepted.

          <P>(2) The MGCRB's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</P>
          <P>(3) The case presents a significant policy issue having a basis in law and regulations, and review is likely to lead to issuance of a CMS Ruling or other directive needed to clarify a provision in the law or regulations.</P>
          <P>(4) The decision of the MGCRB requires clarification, amplication, or an alternative legal basis.</P>
          <P>(5) The MGCRB has incorrectly extended its authority to a degree not provided for by law, regulation, or CMS Ruling.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart implements section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act by establishing a prospective payment system for inpatient hospital capital-related costs. Under this system, payment is made on the basis described in § 412.304 through § 412.374 for inpatient hospital capital-related costs furnished by hospitals subject to the prospective payment system under subpart B of this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of this subpart, a new hospital means a hospital that has operated (under previous or present ownership) for less than 2 years. The following hospitals are not new hospitals:</P>
          <P>(1) A hospital that builds new or replacement facilities at the same or another location even if coincidental with a change of ownership, a change in management, or a lease arrangement.</P>
          <P>(2) A hospital that closes and subsequently reopens.</P>
          <P>(3) A hospital that has been in operation for more than 2 years but has participated in the Medicare program for less than 2 years.</P>
          <P>(4) A hospital that changes its status from a hospital that is excluded from the prospective payment systems to a hospital that is subject to the capital prospective payment systems.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction to capital costs.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">New capital costs.</E> New capital costs are allowable Medicare inpatient hospital capital-related costs under subpart G of part 413 of this chapter <PRTPAGE P="694"/>that are related to assets that were first put in use for patient care after December 31, 1990 (except for such costs deemed to be old capital costs based on prior obligations as described in paragraph (c) of this section) and those allowable capital-related costs related to assets in use prior to December 31, 1990 that are excluded from the definition of old capital costs described in paragraphs (b) (2) through (5) of this section, or are betterment or improvement costs related to those old capital assets.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Old capital costs.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section with respect to capital obligations that qualify for recognition as old capital, old capital costs are allowable capital-related costs for land and depreciable assets that were put in use for patient care on or before December 31, 1990. However, for a new hospital as defined in § 412.300(b), old capital costs are defined as those allowable capital-related costs for land and depreciable assets that were put in use for patient care on or before the later of December 31, 1990 or the last day of the hospital's base year cost reporting period under § 412.328(a)(2). Old capital costs include the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Allowable depreciation on assets based on the useful life guidelines used to determine depreciation expense in the hospital's base period.</P>
          <P>(2) Allowable capital-related interest expense. Except as provided below, the amount of allowable capital-related interest expense that will be recognized as old capital is limited to the amount the hospital was legally obligated to pay as of December 31, 1990. Any allowable interest expense in excess of this limitation will be recognized as new capital.</P>
          <P>(i) An increase in interest expense is recognized if the increase is due to periodic fluctuations of rates in variable interest rate loans or at the time of conversion from a variable rate loan to a fixed rate loan when no other changes in the terms of the loan are made.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the terms of a debt instrument are revised after December 31, 1990, the amount of interest that will be recognized as old capital during the transition cannot exceed the amount that would have been recognized during the same period prior to the revision of the debt instrument.</P>
          <P>(iii) If short-term financing was used to acquire old capital assets and the debt is extended or “rolled-over”, a portion of the extended debt will be recognized as old capital. The portion will equal the ratio of the net book value as of the beginning of the applicable cost reporting period for depreciable assets that were in use in the base year, to the net book value as of the beginning of the base year cost reporting period for those assets. The net book value for the base year will not be adjusted to exclude assets that have been fully depreciated or removed from service since the base year. If the debt is related to specific assets, the ratio will be determined based on the values for those assets. The ratio will exclude assets that were acquired with other identifiable debt instruments. For purposes of this paragraph, short term financing is a debt that becomes due in no later than the earlier of 5 years or half of the average useful life of the assets to which the debt is related.</P>
          <P>(iv) If old capital indebtedness is commingled with new capital debt, the allowable interest expense will be apportioned to old capital costs based on the ratio of the portion of the loan principal related to old capital indebtedness to the total loan principal.</P>
          <P>(v) Investment income, excluding income from funded depreciation accounts, is used to reduce old capital interest expense based on the ratio of total old capital interest expense to total allowable interest expense in each cost reporting period.</P>
          <P>(3) Allowable capital-related lease and rental costs for land and depreciable assets that were obligated as of December 31, 1990.</P>
          <P>(i) Lease renewals up to the annual lease payment level obligated as of December 31, 1990 are recognized provided the same asset remains in use, the asset has a useful life of at least 3 years, and the annual lease payment is $1,000 or more for each item or service.</P>

          <P>(ii) If a hospital-owned asset is sold or given to another party and that same asset is then leased back by the <PRTPAGE P="695"/>hospital, the amount of allowable capital-related costs recognized as old capital costs is limited to the amount allowed for that asset in the last cost reporting period that it was owned by the hospital.</P>
          <P>(iii) If an entire hospital is leased without assumption of the hospital's asset costs after December 31, 1990, the amount of allowable capital-related costs recognized as old capital costs is limited to the amount allowed for old capital costs in the base year or the last cost reporting period these costs were recognized under this subpart, whichever is later.</P>
          <P>(4) The portion of allowable costs for other capital-related expenses (including but not limited to, taxes, insurance, license and royalty fees on depreciable assets) resulting from applying the ratio of the hospital's gross old asset value to total asset value in each cost reporting period.</P>
          <P>(5) The appropriate portion of the capital-related costs of related organizations under § 413.17 that would be recognized as old capital costs if these costs had been incurred directly by the hospital.</P>
          <P>(6) Obligated capital costs that are recognized as old capital costs in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(7) If a hospital had nonreimbursable costs applicable to an old capital asset as of December 31, 1990 that subsequently become allowable inpatient capital-related costs, the allowable costs for such an asset that are attributable to inpatient hospital services are recognized as old capital costs if a portion of the asset was in use for inpatient hospital care on December 31, 1990 and the costs meet all other provisions for recognition of old capital costs contained in this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Obligated capital costs</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Under the conditions described below, capital-related costs attributable to assets that are put in use after December 31, 1990 may be recognized as old capital costs. Any allowable capital-related costs for these assets that are not recognized as old capital costs are recognized as new capital costs.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Fixed assets.</E> The costs of capital-related items and services defined in subpart G of part 413 for which there was a contractual obligation entered into by a hospital or related party with an outside, unrelated party for the construction, reconstruction, lease, rental, or financing of a fixed asset may be recognized as old capital costs if all the following conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(A) The obligation must arise from a binding written agreement that was executed on or before December 31, 1990 and that obligates the hospital on or before December 31, 1990.</P>
          <P>(B) The capital asset must be put in use for patient care before October 1, 1994 except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
          <P>(C) The hospital notifies the intermediary of the existence of obligated capital costs as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
          <P>(D) The amount that is recognized as old capital cost is limited to the lesser of the actual allowable costs when the asset is put in use or the estimated costs of the capital expenditure at the time it was obligated as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Moveable equipment.</E> Moveable equipment is recognized as old capital only if all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (B) through (D) of this section are met and one of the following conditions is met:</P>
          <P>(A) There was a binding contractual agreement that was executed on or before December 31, 1990 and obligates the hospital on or before December 31, 1990 for the lease or purchase of the item of equipment on or before December 31, 1990.</P>
          <P>(B) There was a binding contractual agreement that was executed on or before December 31, 1990 and obligates the hospital on or before December 31, 1990 for financing the acquisition of the equipment; the item of equipment costs at least $100,000; and the item was specifically listed in an equipment purchase plan approved by the Board of Directors on or before December 31, 1990.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Agreements not recognized.</E> Agreements for planning, design or feasibility that do not commit the hospital to undertake a project are not recognized as obligating capital expenditures for purposes of this subsection.<PRTPAGE P="696"/>
          </P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Extension of deadline.</E> CMS may extend the deadline in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, under which an asset must be put in use for patient care before October 1, 1994, to no later than September 30, 1996 for extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, a construction strike or atypically severe weather that significantly delayed completion of a construction project. Normal construction delays do not constitute extraordinary circumstances.</P>
          <P>(A) The hospital must submit its request for an extended deadline with documentation of the extraordinary circumstances by the later of January 1, 1993 or 180 days after the extraordinary circumstance.</P>
          <P>(B) The intermediary reviews the request and verifies the hospital's documentation, and forwards the request to CMS within 60 days. Within 90 days, CMS notifies the intermediary of its decision and, if an extension is granted, of the revised deadline for putting the asset in use for patient care service.</P>
          <P>(v) The hospital must submit to its intermediary the binding agreement and supporting documents that relate to the obligated capital expenditure by the later of October 1, 1992, or within 90 days after the start of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">FY 1992 national average cost per discharge.</E> CMS determines the FY 1992 estimated national average cost per discharge by updating the discharge weighted national average Medicare inpatient hospital capital-related cost per discharge for FY 1989 by the estimated increase in Medicare inpatient hospital capital costs per discharge.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard Federal rate.</E> The standard Federal rate is used to determine the Federal rate for each fiscal year in accordance with the formula specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) CMS determines the standard Federal rate by adjusting the FY 1992 updated national average cost per discharge by a factor so that estimated aggregate payments based on the standard Federal rate adjusted by the payment adjustments described in § 412.312(b) equal estimated aggregate payments based solely on the national average cost per discharge.</P>
          <P>(2) Effective FY 1994, the standard Federal rate used to determine the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is reduced by 7.4 percent.</P>
          <P>(3) Effective FY 1996, the standard Federal rate used to determine the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is reduced by 0.28 percent to account for the effect of the revised policy for payment of transfers under § 412.4(d).</P>
          <P>(4) Effective FY 1998, the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate in effect on September 30, 1997, used to determine the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is reduced by 15.68 percent.</P>

          <P>(5) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 through September 30, 2002, the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate as in <PRTPAGE P="699"/>effect on September 30, 1997, used to determine the Federal rate each year under paragraph (c) of this section is further reduced by 2.1 percent.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">The Federal rate.</E> CMS determines the Federal rate each year by adjusting the standard Federal rate by the following factors.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Update factor.</E> After FY 1992, CMS updates the standard Federal rate as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">FY 1993 through FY 1995.</E> For FY 1993 through FY 1995, the standard Federal rate is updated based on a moving two-year average of actual increases in capital-related costs per discharge for the period three and four years before the fiscal year in question, excluding the portion of the increase attributable to changes in case mix.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Effective FY 1996.</E> Effective FY 1996, the standard Federal rate is updated based on an analytical framework. The framework includes a capital input price index, which measures the annual change in the prices associated with capital-related costs during the year. CMS adjusts the capital input price index rate of change to take into account forecast errors, changes in the case mix index, the effect of changes to DRG classification and relative weights, and allowable changes in the intensity of hospital services.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Outlier payment adjustment factor.</E> CMS reduces the updated standard Federal rate by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments under the Federal rate for outlier cases under subpart F of this part, determined as a proportion of total capital payments under the Federal rate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Exceptions payment adjustment factor.</E> CMS reduces the updated standard Federal rate by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments for exceptions under § 412.348 determined as a proportion of total payments under the hospital-specific rate and Federal rate.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Budget neutrality adjustment factor.</E> (i) For FY 1992 through FY 1995, CMS adjusts the updated standard Federal rate by a budget neutrality factor determined under § 412.352.</P>
          <P>(ii) CMS makes an adjustment to the Federal rate so that estimated aggregate payments for the fiscal year based on the Federal rate after any changes resulting from the annual reclassification and recalibration of the DRG weight in accordance with § 412.60(e) and in the geographic adjustment factors described in § 412.312(b)(2) equal estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate that would have been made without such changes.</P>

          <SUBJECT>General description.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Hospitals under Medicare in FY 1991.</E> During the ten-year transition period, payments to a hospital with a hospital-specific rate below the Federal rate are based on the fully prospective payment methodology under § 412.340 or for a hospital with a hospital-specific rate above the Federal rate, the hold-harmless payment methodology under § 412.344.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">New hospitals.</E> (1) A new hospital, as defined under § 412.300(b), is paid 85 percent of its allowable Medicare inpatient hospital capital-related costs through its cost reporting period ending at least 2 years after the hospital accepts its first patient.<PRTPAGE P="702"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) For the third year through the remainder of the transition period, the hospital is paid based on the fully prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless payment methodology using the base period determined under § 412.328(a)(2).</P>
          <P>(3) If the hospital is paid under the hold-harmless methodology described in § 412.344, the hold-harmless payment for old capital costs described in § 412.344(a)(1) is payable for up to and including 8 years and may continue beyond the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2000.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Hospitals with 52-53 week fiscal years ending September 25 through September 29.</E> For purposes of this subpart, a hospital with a 52-53 week fiscal year period beginning September 26 through September 30, 1992 is deemed to have the same beginning date for all cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 2000 (unless the hospital later changes its cost reporting period).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determining and updating the hospital-specific rate.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Base-year cost reporting period</E>—(1) <E T="03">Last 12 month cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1990.</E> For each hospital, the intermediary uses the hospital's latest 12-month or longer cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1990 as the base period to determine a hospital's hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">New hospitals.</E> The base-year cost reporting period for a new hospital is its 12-month cost reporting period (or a combination of cost reporting periods covering at least 12 months) that begins at least 1 year after the hospital accepts its first patient.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Other hospitals.</E> For other than a new hospital as defined in § 412.300(b), if a hospital does not have a 12-month cost reporting period or does not have adequate Medicare utilization to file a cost report in a period ending on or before December 31, 1990, the hospital-specific rate is based on the hospital's old capital costs (per discharge) in its first 12-month cost reporting period (or combination of cost reporting periods covering at least 12 months) ending after December 31, 1990.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Base-year costs per discharge</E>—(1) <E T="03">Base period allowable inpatient capital costs per discharge</E>—(i) <E T="03">Determination.</E> The intermediary determines the base period allowable inpatient capital costs per discharge for the hospital by dividing the hospital's total allowable Medicare inpatient hospital capital-related cost in the base period by the number of Medicare discharges in the base period.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Disposal of assets in the base year.</E> When a depreciable asset has been disposed of in the base year, only that portion of the gain or loss that is allocated to the base-year cost reporting period is reflected in the hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Disposal of assets subsequent to the base year.</E> If an asset for which the Medicare program had recognized depreciation during the base year is disposed of subsequent to the base year, the hospital-specific rate will not be revised to recognize the portion of the gain or loss allocated to the base year.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Discharges.</E> For the purpose of determining a hospital's base period capital costs per discharge, a discharge includes discharges as defined in § 412.4(a) and transfers as defined in § 412.4(b)(2), adjusted by the transfer adjustment factor that is determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Transfer adjustment factor.</E> (i) For base year cost reporting periods ending on or before December 31, 1990, CMS uses the base year MEDPAR data received as of June 30, 1991 to develop an adjustment to discharges to account for transfers. CMS divides the length of stay for each transfer case by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG (but in no case using a number greater than 1.0) and assigns each nontransfer case a value of 1.0. To determine the transfer adjustment factor, CMS adds together the adjusted discharges and divides the result by total discharges including transfers.</P>

          <P>(ii) For base year cost reporting periods ending after December 31, 1990 but beginning before October 1, 1991, CMS determines a transfer adjustment factor as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for a hospital using the applicable base year MEDPAR data on file as of the December 31 or June 30 <PRTPAGE P="703"/>occurring at least 6 months after the close of the approved base year.</P>
          <P>(iii) For base year cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the intermediary determines the transfer adjustment factor in place of CMS as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section based on the most recent billing data available as of the date of the final determination of the hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Case-mix adjustment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Determining transfer-adjusted case mix value. Step 1:</E> For base year cost reporting periods ending on or before December 31, 1990, CMS uses the base year MEDPAR data received as of June 30, 1991 to determine the hospital's transfer-adjusted case-mix value. For base year cost reporting periods ending after December 31, 1990 and beginning before October 1, 1991, CMS determines a transfer-adjusted case-mix value for a hospital using the applicable base year MEDPAR data on file as of the December 31 or June 30 occurring at least 6 months after the close of the base year. For base year cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, the intermediary determines the transfer-adjusted case-mix value based on the most recent billing data available as of the date of the final determination of the hospital-specific rate. CMS or the intermediary, as appropriate, multiplies the DRG weight for each case by one of the following factors:</P>
          <P>(i) If the case is not a transfer, the factor equals 1.0.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the case is a transfer, the factor equals the lesser of 1.0 or the ratio of the length of stay for the case divided by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="03">Step 2:</E> The products derived for all cases under Step 1 are added together and the result is divided by the adjusted discharges used to calculate the transfer adjustment factor determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</FP>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjusting base period capital costs per discharge by the hospital's transfer-adjusted case-mix value.</E> The intermediary divides the base period capital costs per discharge for each hospital as determined in paragraph (b) of this section by the hospital's transfer-adjusted case mix value for the cost reporting period determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Updating to FY 1992.</E> The intermediary updates the case-mix adjusted base period costs per discharge to FY 1992 based on the national average increase in Medicare inpatient capital costs per discharge as estimated by CMS, excluding the portion of the increase in capital costs per discharge attributable to changes in case mix.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Hospital-specific rate.</E> The intermediary determines the hospital-specific rate each year by adjusting the amount determined under paragraph (d) of this section by the following factors:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Update factor.</E> After FY 1992, the intermediary updates the hospital-specific rate in accordance with § 412.308(c)(1).</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions payment adjustment factor.</E> For FY 1992 through FY 2001, the intermediary reduces the updated amount determined in paragraph (d) of this section by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments for capital-related costs for exceptions under § 412.348, determined as a proportion of the total amount of payments under the hospital-specific rate and Federal rate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Budget neutrality adjustment factor.</E> For FY 1992 through FY 1995, the intermediary adjusts the updated amount determined in paragraph (d) of this section by a budget neutrality adjustment factor determined under § 412.352.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment for transfer cases.</E> Effective FY 1996, the intermediary reduces the updated amount determined in paragraph (d) of this section by 0.28 percent to account for the effect of the revised policy for payment of transfers under § 412.4(d).</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Reduction of rate: FY 1998.</E> Effective FY 1998, the unadjusted hospital-specific rate as in effect on September 30, 1997 described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is reduced by 15.68 percent.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Reduction of rate: FY 1998 through FY 2002.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997 through September 30, 2002, the unadjusted hospital-specific rate in effect on September 30, 1997, described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is further reduced by 2.1 percent.<PRTPAGE P="704"/>
          </P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Redetermination of hospital-specific rate</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) Upon request by a hospital, the intermediary redetermines the hospital-specific rate to reflect an increase in old capital costs as determined in a cost reporting period subsequent to the base year. An increase in Medicare old capital cost per discharge that is related solely to a decline in utilization is not recognized as an increase in old capital costs for purposes of this section. New capital costs are excluded from the redetermination of the hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(ii) The hospital may request redetermination for any cost reporting period beginning subsequent to the base period but no later than the later of the hospital's cost reporting period beginning in FY 1994 or the cost reporting period beginning after obligated capital that is recognized as old capital under § 412.302(b) is put in use.</P>
          <P>(iii) The hospital must request a redetermination in writing no later than the date the cost report must be filed with the hospital's intermediary for the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991 or the cost reporting period that will serve as the new base period, whichever is later. The hospital's redetermination request must include the cost report for the new base period and an estimate of the revised hospital-specific rate indicating that the new rate exceeds the hospital's current hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of old capital costs.</E> The intermediary determines the hospital's old capital costs for the subsequent cost reporting period that will serve as the new base period. The intermediary includes the costs of obligated capital that are recognized as old capital costs under § 412.302(b), excludes the costs of assets disposed of subsequent to the initial base year, and reflects changes in allowable old capital costs occurring subsequent to the initial base period.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Redetermined hospital-specific rate.</E> The intermediary redetermines the hospital-specific rate based on the old capital costs that are determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section for the new base period. The intermediary—</P>
          <P>(i) Divides the hospital's old capital costs for the new base period by the number of Medicare discharges in that cost reporting period (consistent with paragraph (b) of this section);</P>
          <P>(ii) Divides the old capital costs per discharge by the hospital's transfer adjusted case-mix value for the new base period (consistent with paragraph (c) of this section);</P>
          <P>(iii) Applies an update factor, if appropriate, to account for inflation occurring subsequent to the new base year, an exceptions payment adjustment factor, and a budget neutrality adjustment factor (consistent with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Denial by intermediary.</E> If the intermediary determines, after audit, that the revised hospital-specific rate is lower than the current hospital-specific rate, it advises the hospital that its request is denied and explains the basis for the denial.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Implementation date.</E> The redetermined hospital-specific rate applies to discharges occurring on or after the beginning date of the new base period.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Review and revision of the hospital-specific rate</E>—(1) <E T="03">Interim determination.</E> The intermediary makes an interim determination of the hospital-specific rate based on the best data available and notifies the hospital at least 30 days before the beginning of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> (i) The intermediary makes a final determination of the hospital-specific rate based on the final settlement of the base period cost report.</P>
          <P>(ii) The final determination of the hospital-specific rate is effective retroactively to the beginning of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991 or, in the case of a redetermination of the hospital-specific rate under § 412.328(f), to the beginning of the new base period.</P>
          <P>(iii) The final determination of the hospital-specific rate is subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with subpart R of part 405 of this chapter, governing provider reimbursement determinations and appeals.</P>

          <P>(iv) The intermediary adjusts the hospital-specific rate to reflect any revisions that result from administrative <PRTPAGE P="705"/>or judicial review of the final determination of hospital-specific rate. The revised determination is effective retroactively to the same extent as in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determining hospital-specific rates in cases of hospital merger, consolidation, or dissolution.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">New hospital merger or consolidation.</E> If, after a new hospital accepts its first patient but before the end of its base year, it merges with one or more existing hospitals, and two or more separately located hospital campuses are maintained, the hospital-specific rate and payment determination for the merged entity are determined as follows—</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Post-merger base year payment methodology.</E> The new campus is paid based on reasonable costs until the end of its base year. The existing campus remains on its previous payment methodology until the end of the new campus' base year. Effective with the first cost reporting period beginning after the end of the new campus' base year, the intermediary determines a hospital-specific rate applicable to the new campus in accordance with § 412.328, and then determines a revised hospital-specific rate for the merged entity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Revised hospital-specific rate.</E> Using each hospital's base period data, the intermediary determines a combined average discharge-weighted hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Post-base year payment determination.</E> To determine the applicable payment methodology under § 412.336 and for payment purposes under § 412.340 or § 412.344, the discharge-weighted hospital-specific rate determined by the intermediary is compared to the Federal rate. The revised payment methodology is effective on the first day of the cost reporting period beginning after the end of the new campus' base year.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Hospital merger or consolidation.</E> If, after the base year, two or more hospitals merge or consolidate into one hospital as provided for under § 413.134(k) of this chapter and the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply, the intermediary determines a revised hospital-specific rate applicable to the combined facility under § 412.328, which is effective beginning with the date of merger or consolidation. The following rules apply to the revised hospital-specific rate and payment determination:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Revised hospital-specific rate.</E> Using each hospital's base period data, the intermediary determines a combined average discharge weighted hospital-specific rate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment determination.</E> The discharge-weighted hospital-specific rate determined by the intermediary is compared to the Federal rate to establish the appropriate payment methodology under § 412.336 and for payment purposes under §§ 412.340 or 412.344. The revised payment methodology is effective as of the date of merger or consolidation.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Old capital cost determination.</E> The capital-related costs related to the assets of each merged or consolidated hospital as of December 31, 1990 are recognized as old capital costs during the transition period. If the hospital is paid under the hold-harmless methodology after merger or consolidation, only that original base year old capital is eligible for hold-harmless payments.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Hospital dissolution.</E> If a hospital separates into two or more hospitals that are subject to capital payments under this subpart after the base year, the intermediary determines new hospital-specific rates for each separate hospital under the provisions of § 412.328 effective as of the date of the dissolution. The new hospital-specific rates are determined as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Hospital-specific rate</E>—(i) <E T="03">Adequate base year data.</E> The intermediary determines whether the base year capital-related cost data and necessary statistical records are adequate to reconstruct the cost and other data required under § 412.328 from the former hospital's financial records to determine the hospital-specific rates for each facility. If the data are adequate, the intermediary uses the former hospital's base period to determine the hospital-specific rate for each separate hospital.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Inadequate original base year data.</E> If the intermediary determines that <PRTPAGE P="706"/>the base period data for the former hospital is inadequate to establish separate hospital-specific rates, the intermediary establishes a new base period for each hospital. The new base period is each hospital's first 12-month or longer cost reporting period (or combination of cost reporting periods covering at least 12 months) immediately following separation of the hospitals. The intermediary determines the hospital-specific rate for each hospital using the new base period under § 412.328.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment determinations.</E> The intermediary applies the payment methodology provisions of § 412.336. The revised payment determination is effective as of the date of the hospital's dissolution.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Old capital cost determination.</E> In determining the old capital costs for each hospital, the amount recognized as old capital is limited to the allowable capital-related costs attributable to assets that were in use for patient care as of December 31, 1990, and the hospitals are subject to all other transition period rules of this subpart.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A hospital paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology receives a payment per discharge based on the higher of:</P>
          <P>(1) 85 percent of reasonable costs for old capital costs (100 percent for sole community hospitals) plus an amount for new capital costs based on a proportion of the Federal rate. The proportion is equal to the ratio of the hospital's Medicare inpatient costs for new capital to total Medicare inpatient capital costs; or</P>
          <P>(2) 100 percent of the Federal rate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (i) A hospital that would receive higher payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may elect payment based on 100 percent of the Federal rate under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(ii) A hospital that does not maintain records that are adequate to identify its old capital costs is deemed to have elected payment per discharge based on 100 percent of the Federal rate.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Continued basis of payment.</E> A hospital paid based on 100 percent of the Federal rate during the later of its cost reporting period beginning in FY 1994 or its first cost reporting period beginning after obligated capital that is recognized as old capital under § 412.302(b) is put in use continues to be paid on that basis in subsequent cost reporting periods during the transition period and does not receive a reasonable cost <PRTPAGE P="708"/>payment for old capital costs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Basis of determination.</E> The determination under paragraph (a) of this section regarding which payment alternative is applicable is made without regard to additional payments under the exceptions process under § 412.348.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Interim and final payment determinations.</E> (1) Using the best data available, the intermediary makes an interim payment determination under paragraph (a) of this section concerning the applicable payment alternative, and, in the case of payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the payment amounts for old and new capital. The intermediary notifies the hospital of its determination at least 30 days before the beginning of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991. The intermediary may revise its determination based on additional information submitted by the hospital and make appropriate adjustments retroactively.</P>
          <P>(2) The final determination of the amount payable under paragraph (a) of this section is based on final settlement of the Medicare cost report for the applicable cost reporting period and is effective retroactively to the beginning of that cost reporting period. This final determination is subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with subpart R of part 405 of this chapter, governing provider reimbursement determinations and appeals.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section—</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Annual operating expenses.</E> Annual operating expenses means the sum of net expenses for all reimbursable cost centers for a 12 month cost reporting period. Annual operating expenses are obtained from the Medicare cost report.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Average age of fixed assets.</E> The average age of fixed assets is the ratio of accumulated depreciation for buildings and fixed equipment to current depreciation expense for buildings and fixed equipment. The average age of fixed assets is determined from information on the Medicare cost report.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Fixed assets.</E> Fixed assets mean buildings and fixed equipment.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Criterion for additional payment during the transition period.</E> An additional payment is made to a hospital paid under either the fully prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless payment methodology as determined under paragraph (c) of this section for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 and before October 1, 2001.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum payment level by class of hospital.</E> (1) CMS establishes a minimum payment level by class of hospital. The minimum payment level for a hospital will equal a fixed percentage of the hospital's capital-related costs. The minimum payment levels may be no greater than the percentages of allowable capital-related costs that follow:</P>
          <P>(i) 90 percent for sole community hospitals.</P>
          <P>(ii) 80 percent for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of § 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under § 412.105(b), that have a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 20.2 percent as determined under § 412.106(b), and for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of § 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under § 412.106(c)(2).</P>
          <P>(iii) 70 percent for all other hospitals.</P>
          <P>(2) When it is necessary to adjust the minimum payment levels set by class of hospitals specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (g)(6) of this section, CMS will adjust those levels for each class of hospitals in one percentage point increments as necessary to satisfy the requirement specified in paragraph (h) of this section that total estimated payments under the exception process not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for old capital) for the same fiscal year.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional payments.</E> A hospital is entitled to an additional payment if its capital payments for the cost reporting period would otherwise be less than the applicable minimum payment level. The additional payment equals the difference between the applicable minimum payment level and the capital <PRTPAGE P="709"/>payments that the hospital would otherwise receive minus any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Determining a hospital's exception payment amount</E>—(1) <E T="03">Cumulative comparison.</E> For each cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, the hospital's exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Offsetting amounts.</E> Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting period.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional payment exception for extraordinary circumstances.</E> (1) A hospital may request an additional payment if the hospital incurs unanticipated capital expenditures in excess of $5 million (net of proceeds from other payment sources such as insurance, litigation decisions and other State, local or Federal government funding programs) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, a flood, fire, or earthquake.</P>
          <P>(2) A hospital must apply to its CMS Regional Office by the later of October 1, 1992 or 180 days after the extraordinary circumstance causing the unanticipated expenditures for a determination by CMS of whether the hospital is eligible for an additional payment based on the nature of the circumstances and the amount of financial loss documented by the hospital.</P>
          <P>(3) Except for sole community hospitals, the additional payment is based on a minimum payment amount of 85 percent for Medicare's share of allowable capital-related costs attributable to the extraordinary circumstances. For sole community hospitals, the minimum payment amount is 100 percent.</P>
          <P>(4) The minimum payment level applicable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is adjusted to take into account the 85 percent minimum payment level (100 percent for sole community hospitals) under paragraph (f)(3) of this section for the unanticipated capital-related costs. The additional payment for the cost reporting period equals the difference between the adjusted minimum payment level and the capital payments the hospital would otherwise receive less any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Special exceptions process.</E> For eligible hospitals that meet a project need requirement, a project size requirement, and, in the case of certain urban hospitals, meet an excess capacity test, an additional payment may be made for up to 10 years beyond the end of the capital prospective payment system transition period.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Eligible hospitals.</E> The following classes of hospitals are eligible to receive exceptions payments under this special exceptions provision:</P>
          <P>(i) Sole community hospitals.</P>
          <P>(ii) Hospitals located in an urban area under § 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under § 412.105(b), that either have a disproportionate share of at least 20.2 percent as determined under § 412.106(b) or qualify for disproportionate share payments under § 412.106(c)(2).</P>
          <P>(iii) Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Project need requirement.</E> A hospital must show that it has obtained any required approval from a State or local planning authority. If a hospital is not required to obtain approval from a planning authority, it must satisfy the age of asset test specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section and, in the case of an urban hospital, the excess capacity test under paragraph (g)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Age of assets test.</E> A hospital must show that its average age of fixed assets is at or above the 75th percentile for the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Excess capacity test for urban hospitals.</E> Urban hospitals that are not required to receive approval from a State or local planning authority must demonstrate that either—<PRTPAGE P="710"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) The overall average occupancy rate in its metropolitan statistical area is at least 80 percent; or</P>
          <P>(ii) After completion of the project, its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior capacity (in terms of bed size).</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Project size requirement.</E> A hospital must complete, during the period from the beginning of its first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991 to the end of its last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, a project whose costs for replacement and/or renovation of fixed assets related to patient care are at least:</P>
          <P>(i) $200 million; or</P>
          <P>(ii) 100 percent of its operating cost during the first 12 month cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Minimum payment level.</E> (i) The minimum payment level for qualifying hospitals will be 70 percent.</P>
          <P>(ii) CMS will adjust the minimum payment level in one percentage point increments as necessary to satisfy the requirement specified in paragraph (h) of this section that total estimated payments under the exceptions process not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective payment system payments for the same fiscal year.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Limitation on the period for exception payments.</E> A qualifying hospital may receive an exceptions payment for up to 10 years from the year in which it completes a project for replacement or renovation of capital assets that meets project need and project size requirements (and, if applicable, excess capacity test), provided that it completes the project no later than the end of the hospital's last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001. A project is considered to be completed when the assets are put into use for patient care.</P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">Determining a hospital's exception payment amount</E>—(i) <E T="03">Cumulative comparison.</E> For each cost reporting period, the hospital's exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Offsetting amounts.</E> Offsetting amounts are applied in the following order—(A) Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting period.</P>
          <P>(B) Any amount by which the hospital's current year Medicare inpatient operating and capital prospective payment system payments (excluding, if applicable, 75 percent of the hospital's operating prospective payment system disproportionate share payments) exceed its Medicare inpatient operating and capital costs is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for the cost reporting period. For purposes of calculating the offset, the costs and payments for services that are not subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system are excluded.</P>
          <P>(9) <E T="03">Notification requirement.</E> Eligible hospitals must submit documentation to the intermediary indicating the completion date of a project that meets the project need requirement under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the project size requirement under paragraph (g)(5) of this section, and, in the case of certain urban hospitals, an excess capacity test under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, by the later of October 1, 2001 or within 3 months of the end of the hospital's last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, during which a qualifying project was completed.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Limit on exception payments.</E> Total estimated payments under the exception process may not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for old capital) for the same fiscal year.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Basis of payment.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Method of Payment.</E> (1) Under the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system, inpatient psychiatric facilities receive a predetermined Federal per diem base rate for inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare Part A fee-for-service beneficiaries.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Methodology for calculating the Federal per diem payment amount.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Data sources.</E> (1) To calculate the Federal per diem base rate (as specified in paragraph (b) of this section for inpatient psychiatric facilities, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, CMS uses the following data sources:</P>
        <P>(2) The best Medicare data available to estimate the average inpatient operating and capital-related costs per day made as specified in part 413 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(i) Patient and facility cost report data capturing routine and ancillary costs.</P>
        <P>(ii) An appropriate wage index to adjust for wage differences.</P>
        <P>(iii) An increase factor to adjust for the most recent estimate of increases in the prices of an appropriate market basket of goods and services provided by inpatient psychiatric facilities.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining the average per diem cost of inpatient psychiatric facilities for FY 2002.</E> CMS determines the average inpatient operating, ancillary, and capital-related per diem cost for which payment is made to each inpatient psychiatric facility, using the available data described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the Federal per diem base rate for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Payment under the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system is based on a standardized per diem payment referred to as the Federal per diem base rate. The Federal per diem base rate is <PRTPAGE P="715"/>the adjusted cost for 1 day of inpatient hospital services in an inpatient psychiatric facility in a base year as described in paragraph (b) of this section. The adjusted cost per day is adjusted in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Update of the average per diem cost.</E> CMS applies the increase factor described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section to the updated average per diem cost to the midpoint of the January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006, under the update methodology described in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Budget neutrality.</E> (i) CMS adjusts the updated average per diem cost so that the aggregate payments in the first 18 months (for January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006) under the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system are estimated to equal the amount that would have been made to the inpatient psychiatric facilities under part 413 of this chapter if the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system described in this subpart were not implemented.</P>
        <P>(ii) CMS evaluates the accuracy of the budget-neutrality adjustment within the first 5 years after implementation of the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system. CMS may make a one-time prospective adjustment to the Federal per diem base rate to account for significant differences between the historical data on cost-based TEFRA payments (the basis of the budget-neutrality adjustment at the time of implementation) and estimates of TEFRA payments based on actual data from the first year of the prospective payment system.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Outlier payments.</E> CMS determines a reduction factor equal to the estimated proportion of outlier payments described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Standardization.</E> CMS determines a reduction factor to reflect estimated increases in the Federal per diem base rate as defined in § 412.402 resulting from the facility-level and patient-level adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Computation of the Federal per diem base rate.</E> The Federal per diem base rate is computed as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005 and on or before June 30, 2006, the Federal per diem base rate is computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) For inpatient psychiatric facilities beginning on or after July 1, 2006, the Federal per diem base rate will be the Federal per diem base rate for the previous year, updated by an increase factor described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Determining the Federal per diem payment amount.</E> The Federal per diem payment amount is the product of the Federal per diem base rate established under paragraph (c) of this section, the facility-level adjustments applicable to the inpatient psychiatric facility, patient-level adjustments and other policy adjustments applicable to the case.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Facility-level adjustments</E>—(i) <E T="03">Adjustment for wages.</E> CMS adjusts the labor portion of the Federal per diem base rate to account for geographic differences in the area wage levels using an appropriate wage index. The application of the wage index is made on the basis of the location of the inpatient psychiatric facility in an urban or rural area as defined in § 412.402.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Rural location.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate for inpatient psychiatric facilities located in a rural area as defined in § 412.402.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Teaching adjustment.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate by a factor to account for indirect teaching costs.</P>
        <P>(A) An inpatient psychiatric facility's teaching adjustment is based on the ratio of the number of full-time equivalent residents training in the inpatient psychiatric facility divided by the facility's average daily census.</P>
        <P>(B) Residents with less than full-time status and residents rotating through the inpatient psychiatric facility for less than a full year will be counted in proportion to the time they spend in the inpatient psychiatric facility.</P>

        <P>(C) Except as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(D) of this section, the actual number of current year full-time equivalent residents used in calculating the teaching adjustment is limited to the number of full-time equivalent residents in the inpatient psychiatric facility's most recently filed cost report <PRTPAGE P="716"/>filed with its fiscal intermediary before November 15, 2004 (base year).</P>
        <P>(D) If the inpatient psychiatric facility first begins training residents in a new approved graduate medical education program after November 15, 2004, the number of full-time equivalent residents determined under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section may be adjusted using the method described in § 413.79(e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(E) The teaching adjustment is made on a claim basis as an interim payment, and the final payment in full for the claim is made during the final settlement of the cost report.</P>
        <P>(F) <E T="03">Closure of an IPF.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2011, an IPF may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap to reflect residents added because of another IPF's closure if the IPF meets the following criteria:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The IPF is training additional residents from an IPF that closed on or after July 1, 2011.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) No later than 60 days after the IPF begins to train the residents, the IPF submits a request to its Medicare contractor for a temporary adjustment to its cap, documents that the IPF is eligible for this temporary adjustment by identifying the residents who have come from the closed IPF and have caused the IPF to exceed its cap, and specifies the length of time the adjustment is needed.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Closure of an IPF's residency training program.</E> If an IPF that closes its residency training program on or after July 1, 2011, agrees to temporarily reduce its FTE cap according to the criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(F)(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>) of this section, another IPF(s) may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap to reflect residents added because of the closure of the residency training program if the criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(F)(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>) of this section are met.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) <E T="03">Receiving IPF(s).</E> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2011, an IPF may receive a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap to reflect residents added because of the closure of another IPF's residency training program if the IPF is training additional residents from the residency training program of an IPF that closed a program; and if no later than 60 days after the IPF begins to train the residents, the IPF submits to its Medicare Contractor a request for a temporary adjustment to its FTE cap, documents that it is eligible for this temporary adjustment by identifying the residents who have come from another IPF's closed program and have caused the IPF to exceed its cap, specifies the length of time the adjustment is needed, and submits to its Medicare contractor a copy of the FTE reduction statement by the hospital that closed its program, as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(F)(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>) of this section.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) <E T="03">IPF that closed its program.</E> An IPF that agrees to train residents who have been displaced by the closure of another IPF's program may receive a temporary FTE cap adjustment only if the hospital with the closed program temporarily reduces its FTE cap based on the FTE residents in each program year training in the program at the time of the program's closure. This yearly reduction in the FTE cap will be determined based on the number of those residents who would have been training in the program during that year had the program not closed. No later than 60 days after the residents who were in the closed program begin training at another hospital, the hospital with the closed program must submit to its Medicare contractor a statement signed and dated by its representative that specifies that it agrees to the temporary reduction in its FTE cap to allow the IPF training the displaced residents to obtain a temporary adjustment to its cap; identifies the residents who were in training at the time of the program's closure; identifies the IPFs to which the residents are transferring once the program closes; and specifies the reduction for the applicable program years.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Inpatient psychiatric facilities located in Alaska and Hawaii.</E> CMS adjusts the non-labor portion of the Federal per diem base rate to reflect the higher cost of living of inpatient psychiatric facilities located in Alaska and Hawaii.</P>
        <P>(v) <E T="03">Adjustment for IPF with qualifying emergency departments.</E> (A) CMS adjusts <PRTPAGE P="717"/>the Federal per diem base rate to account for the costs associated with maintaining a qualifying emergency department. A qualifying emergency department is staffed and equipped to furnish a comprehensive array of emergency services (medical and psychiatric) and meets the requirements of §§ 489.24(b) and 413.65 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(B) Where the inpatient psychiatric facility is part of an acute care hospital that has a qualifying emergency department as described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section and an individual patient is discharged to the inpatient psychiatric facility from that acute care hospital, CMS would not apply the emergency adjustment.</P>
        <P>(vi) <E T="03">Applicable percentage change for fiscal year 2014 payment determination and for subsequent years.</E> (A) In the case of an inpatient psychiatric facility that is paid under the prospective payment system in § 412.1(a)(2) that does not submit quality data to CMS, in the form and manner and at a time specified by CMS, the applicable annual update to a Federal standard rate is reduced by 2.0 percentage points.</P>
        <P>(B) Any reduction in the applicable annual update to a Federal standard rate will apply only to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the annual payment update for a subsequent year.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Patient-level adjustments.</E> The inpatient psychiatric facility must identify a principal psychiatric diagnosis as specified in § 412.27(a) for each patient. CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate by a factor to account for the diagnosis-related group assignment associated with the principal diagnosis, as specified by CMS.</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Age.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate to account for patient age based on age groupings specified by CMS.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Diagnosis-related group assignment.</E> The inpatient psychiatric facility must identify a principal diagnosis as specified in § 412.27(a) for each patient. CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate by a factor to account for the CMS inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system recognized diagnosis-related group assignment associated with each patient's principal diagnosis.</P>
        <P>(iii) [Reserved]</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Comorbidities.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate by a factor to account for certain comorbidities as specified by CMS.</P>
        <P>(v) <E T="03">Variable per diem adjustments.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal per diem base rate by factors as specified by CMS to account for the cost of each day of inpatient psychiatric care relative to the cost of the median length of stay.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Other adjustments.</E> (i) <E T="03">Outlier payments.</E> CMS provides an outlier payment if an inpatient psychiatric facility's estimated total cost for a case exceeds a fixed dollar loss threshold amount for an inpatient psychiatric facility as defined in § 412.402 plus the Federal payment amount for the case.</P>
        <P>(A) The fixed dollar loss threshold amount is adjusted for the inpatient psychiatric facility's adjustments for wage area, teaching, rural locations, and cost of living adjustment for facilities located in Alaska and Hawaii.</P>
        <P>(B) The outlier payment equals a percentage of the difference between the IPF's estimated cost for the case and the adjusted threshold amount specified by CMS for each day of the inpatient stay.</P>
        <P>(C) For discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005, outlier payments are subject to the adjustments specified at §§ 412.84(i) and 412.84(m) of this part, except that national urban and rural median cost-to-charge ratios would be used instead of statewide average cost-to-charge ratios.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Stop-loss payments.</E> CMS will provide additional payments during the transition period, specified in § 412.426(a)(1) through (3), to an inpatient psychiatric facility to ensure that aggregate payments under the prospective payment system are at least 70 percent of the amount the inpatient psychiatric facility would have received under reasonable cost reimbursement had the prospective payment system not been implemented.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special payment provision for interrupted stays.</E> If a patient is discharged from an inpatient psychiatric facility and is admitted to the same or another inpatient psychiatric facility <PRTPAGE P="718"/>within 3 consecutive calendar days following the discharge, the case is considered to be continuous for the purposes listed below. The 3 consecutive calendar days begins with the day of discharge from the inpatient psychiatric facility and ends on midnight of day 3.</P>
        <P>(A) Determining the appropriate variable per diem adjustment, as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, applicable to the case.</P>
        <P>(B) Determining whether the total cost for a case meets the criteria for outlier payments, as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iv) Payment for electroconvulsive therapy treatments. CMS provides an additional payment to reflect the cost of electroconvulsive therapy treatments received by a patient during an inpatient psychiatric facility stay in a manner specified by CMS.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Method of payment under the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an inpatient psychiatric facility receives payment under this subpart for inpatient operating cost and capital-related costs for each inpatient stay following submission of a bill.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Periodic interim payments (PIP).</E> (1) Criteria for receiving PIP.</P>
        <P>(i) An inpatient psychiatric facility receiving payment under this subpart may receive PIP for Part A services under the PIP method subject to the provisions of § 413.64(h) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) To be approved for PIP, the inpatient psychiatric facility must meet the qualifying requirements in § 413.64(h)(3) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(iii) A hospital that is receiving periodic interim payments also receives payment under this subpart for applicable services furnished by its excluded psychiatric unit.</P>
        <P>(iv) As provided in § 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter, intermediary approval is conditioned upon the intermediary's best judgment as to whether payment can be made under the PIP method without undue risk of resulting in an overpayment to the provider.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Frequency of payment.</E> For facilities approved for PIP, the intermediary estimates the annual inpatient psychiatric facility's Federal per diem prospective payments, net of estimated beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance, and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount of payment for the year. If the inpatient psychiatric facility has payment experience under the prospective payment system, the intermediary estimates PIP based on that payment experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by substantiated information for the current year. Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as specified in § 413.64(h)(6) of this chapter. The interim payments are reviewed at least <PRTPAGE P="720"/>twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if an inpatient psychiatric facility receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are subject to final settlement.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Termination of PIP.</E> (i) <E T="03">Request by the inpatient psychiatric facility.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, an inpatient psychiatric facility receiving PIP may convert to receiving prospective payments on a non-PIP basis at any time.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Removal by the intermediary.</E> An intermediary terminates PIP if the inpatient psychiatric facility no longer meets the requirements of § 413.64(h) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim payments for Medicare bad debts and for costs of an approved education program and other costs paid outside the prospective payment system.</E> For Medicare bad debts and for costs of an approved education program and other costs paid outside the prospective payment system, the intermediary determines the interim payments by estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the previous year's experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by substantiated information for the current year, and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount. Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of the biweekly period of service as specified in § 413.64(h)(6) of this chapter. The interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if an inpatient psychiatric facility receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are subject to final cost settlement.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Outlier payments.</E> Additional payments for outliers are not made on an interim basis. Outlier payments are made based on the submission of a discharge bill and represents final payment subject to the cost report settlement specified in § 412.84(i) and § 412.84(m) of this part.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Accelerated payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Upon request, an accelerated payment may be made to an inpatient psychiatric facility that is receiving payment under this subpart and is not receiving PIP under paragraph (b) of this section if the inpatient psychiatric facility is experiencing financial difficulties because of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) There is a delay by the intermediary in making payment to the inpatient psychiatric facility.</P>
        <P>(ii) Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in the inpatient psychiatric facility's preparation and submittal of bills to the intermediary beyond the normal billing cycle.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Approval of accelerated payment.</E> An inpatient psychiatric facility's request for an accelerated payment must be approved by the intermediary and CMS.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of accelerated payment.</E> The amount of the accelerated payment is computed as a percent of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid covered services.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Recovery of accelerated payment.</E> Recovery of the accelerated payment is made by recoupment as inpatient psychiatric facility bills are processed or by direct payment by the inpatient psychiatric facility.</P>

        <P>(1) If Medicare has paid at the full LTCH prospective payment system standard Federal payment rate, that payment applies to the hospital's costs for services furnished until the high-cost outlier threshold is met.</P>
        <P>(2) If Medicare pays less than the full LTCH prospective payment system standard Federal payment rate and payment was not made at the site neutral payment rate (including, when applicable, the blended payment rate), that payment only applies to the hospital's costs for those costs or days used to calculate the Medicare payment.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Classification methodology.</E> CMS classifies specific inpatient hospital discharges from long-term care hospitals by long-term care diagnosis-related groups (LTC-DRGs) to ensure that each hospital discharge is appropriately assigned based on essential data abstracted from the inpatient bill for that discharge.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Assignment of discharges to LTC-DRGs.</E> (1) The classification of a particular discharge is based, as appropriate, on the patient's age, sex, principal diagnosis (that is, the diagnosis established after study to be chiefly responsible for causing the patient's admission to the hospital), secondary diagnoses, procedures performed, and the patient's discharge status.</P>
        <P>(2) Each discharge from a long-term care hospital is assigned to only one LTC-DRG (related, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to the patient's principal diagnosis), regardless of the number of conditions treated or services furnished during the patient's stay.</P>
        <P>(3) When the discharge data submitted by a hospital show a surgical procedure unrelated to a patient's principal diagnosis, the bill is returned to the hospital for validation and reverification. The LTC-DRG classification system provides a LTC-DRG, and an appropriate weighting factor, for those cases for which none of the surgical procedures performed are related to the principal diagnosis.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of LTC-DRG assignment.</E> (1) A hospital has 60 days after the date of the notice of the initial assignment of a discharge to a LTC-DRG to request a review of that assignment. The hospital may submit additional information as a part of its request.</P>
        <P>(2) The intermediary reviews that hospital's request and any additional information and decides whether a change in the LTC-DRG assignment is appropriate. If the intermediary decides that a different LTC-DRG should be assigned, the case will be reviewed by the appropriate QIO as specified in § 476.71(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(3) Following the 60-day period described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the hospital may not submit additional information with respect to the DRG assignment or otherwise revise its claim.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Basis of payment.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Method of payment.</E> (1) Under the prospective payment system, long-term care hospitals receive a predetermined payment amount per discharge for inpatient services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.</P>

        <P>(2) Except as provided for in § 412.526, the amount of payment under the prospective payment system is based on <PRTPAGE P="727"/>either the long-term care hospital prospective payment system standard Federal payment rate established in accordance with § 412.523, including adjustments described in § 412.525, or the site neutral payment rate established in accordance with § 412.522(c), or, if applicable during a transition period, the blend of the LTCH PPS standard Federal payment rate and the applicable site neutral payment rate described in § 412.522(c)(3).</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment in full.</E> (1) The payment made under this subpart represents payment in full (subject to applicable deductibles and coinsurance described in subpart G of part 409 of this subchapter) for covered inpatient operating costs as described in §§ 412.2(c)(1) through (c)(4) of this part and § 412.540 and capital-related costs described in subpart G of part 413 of this subchapter associated with furnishing Medicare covered services in long-term care hospitals.</P>
        <P>(2) In addition to payment based on prospective payment rates, long-term care hospitals may receive payments separate from payments under the prospective payment system for the following:</P>
        <P>(i) The costs of approved medical education programs described in §§ 413.75 through 413.83, 413.85, and 413.87 of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) Bad debts of Medicare beneficiaries, as provided in § 413.89 of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(iii) A payment amount per unit for blood clotting factor provided to Medicare inpatients who have hemophilia.</P>
        <P>(iv) Anesthesia services furnished by hospital employed nonphysician anesthetists or obtained under arrangements, as specified in § 412.113(c)(2).</P>
        <P>(v) The costs of photocopying and mailing medical records requested by a QIO, in accordance with § 476.78(c) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment by workers' compensation, automobile medical, no-fault or liability insurance or an employer group health plan primary to Medicare.</E> If workers' compensation, automobile medical, no-fault, or liability insurance or an employer group health plan that is primary to Medicare pays in full or in part, payment is determined in accordance with the guidelines specified in § 412.120(b).</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of change of ownership on payments under the prospective payment system.</E> When a hospital's ownership changes, as described in § 489.18 of this chapter, the following rules apply:</P>
        <P>(1) Payment for the operating and capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services for each patient, including outlier payments as provided in § 412.525 and payments for hemophilia clotting factor costs as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, are made to the entity that is the legal owner on the date of discharge. Payments are not prorated between the buyer and seller.</P>
        <P>(i) The owner on the date of discharge is entitled to submit a bill for all inpatient hospital services furnished to a beneficiary regardless of when the beneficiary's coverage began or ended during a stay, or of how long the stay lasted.</P>
        <P>(ii) Each bill submitted must include all information necessary for the intermediary to compute the payment amount, whether or not some of that information is attributable to a period during which a different party legally owned the hospital.</P>
        <P>(2) Other payments for the direct costs of approved medical education programs, bad debts, anesthesia services furnished by hospital employed nonphysician anesthetists, and costs of photocopying and mailing medical records to the QIO as provided for under paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of this section are made to each owner or operator of the hospital (buyer and seller) in accordance with the principles of reasonable cost reimbursement.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Special payment provisions for patients in acute care hospitals that change classification status to LTCH status during a patient stay.</E> (1) If a patient is admitted to an acute care hospital and then the acute care hospital meets the criteria at § 412.23(e) to be paid as a LTCH during the course of the patient's hospitalization, Medicare considers all the days of the patient stay in the facility (days prior to and after the designation of LTCH status) to be a single episode of LTCH care. Payment for the entire patient stay (days prior <PRTPAGE P="728"/>to and after the designation of LTCH status) will include the day and cost data for that patient at both the acute care hospital and the LTCH in determining the payment to the LTCH under this subpart. The requirements of this paragraph (e)(1) apply only to a patient stay in which a patient is in an acute care hospital and that hospital is designated as a LTCH on or after October 1, 2004.</P>
        <P>(2) The days of the patient's stay prior to and after the hospital's designation as a LTCH as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are included for purposes of determining the beneficiary's length of stay.</P>

        <P>(i) 50 percent of the site neutral payment rate amount for the discharge as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and</P>
        <P>(ii) 50 percent of the standard Federal prospective payment rate amount for the discharge as determined under § 412.523.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Discharge payment percentage.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the discharge payment percentage is a ratio, expressed as a percentage, of Medicare discharges that meet the criteria for exclusion from the site neutral payment rate as described under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to total Medicare discharges paid under this subpart during the cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(2) CMS will inform each long-term care hospital of its discharge payment percentage, as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for each cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 2015.</P>
        <P>(3) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2019, if a long-term care hospital's discharge payment percentage for the cost reporting period is not at least 50 percent, discharges in all cost reporting periods beginning after the notification described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be paid under the payment adjustment described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section until reinstated under paragraph (d)(5) or (6) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) For cost reporting periods subject to the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the payment for all discharges consists of—</P>
        <P>(i) An amount equivalent to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system amount as determined under § 412.529(d)(4)(i)(A) and (d)(4)(ii) and (iii); and</P>
        <P>(ii) If applicable, an additional payment for high cost outlier cases based on the fixed-loss amount established for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system in effect at the time of the LTCH discharge.</P>
        <P>(5) For full reinstatement—</P>
        <P>(i) When the discharge payment percentage for a cost reporting period is calculated to be at least 50 percent, any payment adjustment described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section will be discontinued for cost reporting periods beginning on or after the notification described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) A long-term care hospital reinstated under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section will be subject to the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section if, after being reinstated, it again meets the criteria in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(6) For special probationary reinstatement—</P>
        <P>(i) A hospital that would be subject to the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section for a cost reporting period will have application of the payment adjustment delayed for that period if, for the period of at least 5 consecutive months of the 6 months immediately preceding the cost reporting period, the discharge payment percentage is calculated to be at least 50 percent.</P>

        <P>(ii) For any cost reporting period to which the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section would have applied but for a delay under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the payment adjustment under paragraph (d)(4) of this section will be applied to <PRTPAGE P="731"/>all discharges in the cost reporting period if the discharge payment percentage for the cost reporting period is not calculated to be at least 50 percent.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Methodology for calculating the Federal prospective payment rates.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Data used.</E> To calculate the initial prospective payment rates for inpatient hospital services furnished by long-term care hospitals, CMS uses—</P>
        <P>(1) The best Medicare data available; and</P>
        <P>(2) A rate of increase factor to adjust for the most recent estimate of increases in the prices of an appropriate market basket of goods and services included in covered inpatient long-term care hospital services.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining the average costs per discharge for FY 2003.</E> CMS determines the average inpatient operating and capital-related costs per discharge for which payment is made to each inpatient long-term care hospital using the available data under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The cost per discharge is adjusted to FY 2003 by a rate of increase factor, described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, under the update methodology described in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act for each year.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the Federal prospective payment rates</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Federal prospective payment rates will be established using a standard payment amount referred to as the standard Federal rate. The standard Federal rate is a standardized payment amount based on average costs from a base year that reflects the combined aggregate effects of the weighting factors and other adjustments.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Update the cost per discharge.</E> CMS applies the increase factor described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to each hospital's cost per discharge determined under paragraph (b) of this section to compute the cost per discharge for FY 2003. Based on the updated cost per discharge, CMS estimates the payments that would have been made to each hospital for FY 2003 under Part 413 of this chapter without regard to the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Computation of the standard Federal rate.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the standard Federal rate is computed as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">For FY 2003.</E> Based on the updated costs per discharge and estimated payments for FY 2003 determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, CMS computes a standard Federal rate for FY 2003 that reflects, as appropriate, the adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section. The FY 2003 standard Federal rate is effective for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate years beginning on or after July 1, 2003 and ending on or before June 30, 2006.</E> The standard Federal rate for long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate years beginning on or after July 1, 2003 and ending on or before June 30, 2006 is the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year, updated by the increase factor described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. For the rate year from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004, the updated and adjusted standard Federal rate is offset by a budget neutrality factor to account for updating the FY 2003 standard Federal rate on July 1 rather than October 1.</P>
        <P>(iii) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning July 1, 2006 and ending June 30, 2007.</E> The standard Federal rate for long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning July 1, 2006 and ending June 30, 2007 is the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year updated by zero percent. The standard Federal rate is adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iv) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning July 1, 2007 and ending June 30, 2008.</E> (A) The standard Federal rate for long-term care hospital prospective <PRTPAGE P="732"/>payment system rate year beginning July 1, 2007 and ending June 30, 2008 is the same as the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year. The standard Federal rate is adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(B) With respect to discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2007 and before April 1, 2008, payments are based on the standard Federal rate in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section updated by 0.71 percent.</P>
        <P>(v) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning July 1, 2008 and ending September 30, 2009.</E> The standard Federal rate for long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning July 1, 2008 and ending September 30, 2009 is the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year updated by 2.7 percent. The standard Federal rate is adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(vi) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning October 1, 2009 and ending September 30, 2010.</E> (A) The standard Federal rate for long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year beginning October 1, 2009 and ending September 30, 2010 is the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year updated by 1.74 percent. The standard Federal rate is adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(B) With respect to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2009 and before April 1, 2010, payments are based on the standard Federal rate in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section updated by 2.0 percent.</P>
        <P>(vii) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system fiscal year beginning October 1, 2010, and ending September 30, 2011.</E> The standard Federal rate for the long-term care hospital prospective payment system fiscal year beginning October 1, 2010, and ending September 30, 2011, is the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system rate year updated by −0.49 percent. The standard Federal rate is adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(viii) <E T="03">For long-term care hospital prospective payment system fiscal year beginning October 1, 2011, and ending September 30, 2012.</E> The standard Federal rate for the long-term care hospital prospective payment system beginning October 1, 2011, and ending September 30, 2012, is the standard Federal rate for the previous long-term care hospital prospective payment system fiscal year updated by 1.8 percent. The standard Federal rate is adjusted, as appropriate, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

        <P>(i) In the case of a long-term care hospital that does not submit quality reporting data to CMS in the form and manner and at a time specified by the Secretary, the annual update to the standard Federal rate specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is further reduced by 2.0 percentage points.</P>
        <P>(ii) Any reduction of the annual update to the standard Federal rate under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section will apply only to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the annual update to the standard Federal rate for a subsequent fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Determining the Federal prospective payment rate for each LTC-DRG.</E> The Federal prospective payment rate for each LTC-DRG is the product of the weighting factors described in § 412.515 and the standard Federal rate described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustments to the standard Federal rate.</E> The standard Federal rate described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be adjusted for—</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Outlier payments.</E> CMS adjusts the LTCH PPS standard Federal payment rate by a reduction factor of 8 percent, the estimated proportion of outlier payments under § 412.525(a) payable for discharges described in § 412.522(a)(2) (notwithstanding the provisions of § 412.525(a)(2)(ii) for FY 2018 and subsequent years.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Budget neutrality.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal prospective payment rates for <PRTPAGE P="734"/>FY 2003 so that aggregate payments under the prospective payment system are estimated to equal the amount that would have been paid to long-term care hospitals under part 413 of this subchapter without regard to the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart, excluding the effects of section 1886(b)(2)(E) and (b)(3)(J) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The Secretary reviews payments under this prospective payment system and may make a one-time prospective adjustment to the long-term care hospital prospective payment system rates no earlier than December 29, 2012, so that the effect of any significant difference between the data used in the original computations of budget neutrality for FY 2003 and more recent data to determine budget neutrality for FY 2003 is not perpetuated in the prospective payment rates for future years.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adjustment to the standard Federal rate.</E> The standard Federal rate determined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is permanently adjusted by 3.75 percent to account for the estimated difference between projected aggregate payments in FY 2003 made under the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart and the projected aggregate payments that would have been made in FY 2003 under Part 413 of this chapter without regard to the implementation of the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart, excluding the effects of sections 1886(b)(2)(E) and (b)(3)(J) of the Act.

        <P>(4) <E T="03">Changes to the adjustment for area wage levels.</E> Beginning in FY 2012, CMS adjusts the standard Federal rate by a factor that accounts for the estimated effect of any adjustments or updates to the area wage level adjustment under § 412.525(c)(1) on estimated aggregate LTCH PPS payments.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Adjustment for changes to the short-stay outlier policy.</E> The standard Federal rate determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section is permanently adjusted by a one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2018 are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the change in the short-stay outlier policy for FY 2018 under § 412.529(c)(4).</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Adjustment for the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals.</E> The standard Federal payment rate determined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is adjusted as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2018 and before October 1, 2019, by a one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2019, and the portion of estimated aggregate payments to site neutral cases that are paid based on the LTCH PPS standard Federal rate in FY 2019, are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals. This adjustment only applies to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the standard Federal payment rate for a subsequent fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(ii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2019 and before October 1, 2020, by a one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2020, and the portion of estimated aggregate payments to site neutral payment rate cases that are paid based on the LTCH PPS standard Federal rate in FY 2020, are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals. This adjustment only applies to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the standard Federal payment rate for a subsequent fiscal year.</P>

        <P>(iii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2020, by a permanent, <PRTPAGE P="735"/>one-time factor so that estimated aggregate payments to LTCH PPS standard Federal rate cases in FY 2021 are projected to equal estimated aggregate payments that would have been paid for such cases without regard to the elimination of the limitation on long-term care hospital admissions from referring hospitals.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculation of the adjusted Federal prospective payment.</E> For each discharge, a long-term care hospital's Federal prospective payment is computed on the basis of the Federal prospective payment rate multiplied by the relative weight of the LTC-DRG assigned for that discharge. A hospital's Federal prospective payment rate will be adjusted, as appropriate, to account for outliers and other factors as specified in § 412.525.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Adjustments to the Federal prospective payment.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Adjustments for high-cost outliers.</E> (1) CMS provides for an additional payment to a long-term care hospital if its estimated costs for a patient exceed the applicable long-term care hospital prospective payment system payment plus an applicable fixed-loss amount. For each long-term care hospital prospective payment system payment year, CMS annually establishes a fixed-loss amount that is the maximum loss that a long-term care hospital would incur under the long-term care hospital prospective payment system for a case with unusually high costs before receiving an additional payment.</P>
        <P>(2)(i) The fixed loss-amount for discharges from a long-term care hospital described under § 412.522(a)(2) is determined for the long-term care hospital prospective payment system payment year, using the LTC-DRG relative weights that are in effect at the start of the applicable long-term care hospital prospective payment system payment year.</P>
        <P>(ii) For FY 2018 and subsequent years, the fixed-loss amount for long-term care hospital discharges described under § 412.522(a)(2) is determined such that the estimated proportion of outlier payments under paragraph (a) of this section payable for such discharges is projected to be equal to 99.6875 of 8 percent.</P>
        <P>(3) The additional payment equals 80 percent of the difference between the estimated cost of the patient's care (determined by multiplying the hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio by the Medicare allowable covered charge) and the sum of the applicable long-term care hospital prospective payment system payment and the applicable fixed-loss amount.</P>
        <P>(4)(i) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2002 and before August 8, 2003, no reconciliations will be made to outlier payments upon cost report settlement to account for differences between the estimated cost-to-charge ratio and the actual cost-to-charge ratio of the case.</P>
        <P>(ii) For discharges occurring on or after August 8, 2003, and before October 1, 2006, high-cost outlier payments are subject to the provisions of § 412.84(i)(1), (i)(3), and (i)(4) and (m) for adjustments of cost-to-charge ratios.</P>
        <P>(iii) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2003, and before October 1, 2006, high-cost outlier payments are subject to the provisions of § 412.84(i)(2) for adjustments to cost-to-charge ratios.</P>
        <P>(iv) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006, high-cost outlier payments are subject to the following provisions:</P>
        <P>(A) CMS may specify an alternative to the cost-to-charge ratio otherwise applicable under paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. A hospital may also request that its fiscal intermediary use a different (higher or lower) cost-to-charge ratio based on substantial evidence presented by the hospital. A request must be approved by the CMS Regional Office.</P>
        <P>(B) The cost-to-charge ratio applied at the time a claim is processed is based on either the most recent settled cost report or the most recent tentatively settled cost report, whichever is from the latest cost reporting period.</P>

        <P>(C) The fiscal intermediary may use a statewide average cost-to-charge ratio, which CMS establishes annually, if it is <PRTPAGE P="736"/>unable to determine an accurate cost-to-charge ratio for a hospital in one of the following circumstances:</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A new hospital that has not yet submitted its first Medicare cost report. (For this purpose, a new hospital is defined as an entity that has not accepted assignment of an existing hospital's provider agreement in accordance with § 489.18 of this chapter.)</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A hospital whose cost-to-charge ratio is in excess of 3 standard deviations above the corresponding national geometric mean cost-to-charge ratio. CMS establishes and publishes this mean annually.</P>
        <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any other hospital for which data to calculate a cost-to-charge ratio are not available.</P>
        <P>(D) Any reconciliation of outlier payments is based on the cost-to-charge ratio calculated based on a ratio of costs to charges computed from the relevant cost report and charge data determined at the time the cost report coinciding with the discharge is settled.</P>
        <P>(E) At the time of any reconciliation under paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(D) of this section, outlier payments may be adjusted to account for the time value of any underpayments or overpayments. Any adjustment is based upon a widely available index to be established in advance by the Secretary, and is applied from the midpoint of the cost reporting period to the date of reconciliation.</P>
        <P>(5) For purposes of this paragraph (a)—</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">Applicable long-term care hospital prospective payment system payment</E> means—</P>
        <P>(A) The site neutral payment rate established under § 412.522(c) for long-term care hospital discharges described under § 412.522(a)(1);</P>
        <P>(B) The standard Federal prospective payment rates established under § 412.523 for long-term care hospital discharges described under § 412.522(a)(2); or</P>

        <SUBJECT>Payment provisions for a “subclause (II)” long-term care hospital.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> A “subclause (II)” long-term care hospital is a hospital that qualifies as an LTCH under section 1886(d)(1)(B)(iv)(II) of the Act.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of payment.</E> (1) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2003 and before September 30, 2014, payment to a “subclause (II)” long-term care hospital is made under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(4) and Subpart O of this part.</P>
        <P>(2) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014, payment to a “subclause (II)” long-term care hospital is made under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(4) and under Subpart O of this part, as adjusted. The adjusted payment amount is determined based on reasonable cost, as described at § 412.526(c).</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the adjusted payment for Medicare inpatient operating and capital-related costs under the reasonable cost-based reimbursement rules.</E> Medicare inpatient operating costs are paid based on reasonable cost, subject to a ceiling. The ceiling is the aggregate upper limit on the amount of a hospital's net Medicare inpatient operating costs that the program will recognize for payment purposes, as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Ceiling.</E> For each cost reporting period, the ceiling is determined by multiplying the updated target amount, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for that period by the number of Medicare discharges paid under this subpart during that period.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Target amounts.</E> (i) For cost reporting periods beginning during Federal fiscal year 2015, the target amount equals the hospital's target amount determined under § 413.40(c)(4) for its cost reporting period beginning during Federal fiscal year 2000, updated by the applicable annual rate-of-increase percentages specified in § 413.40(c)(3) to the subject period.</P>
        <P>(ii) For subsequent cost reporting periods, the target amount equals the hospital's target amount for the previous cost reporting period updated by the applicable annual rate-of-increase percentage specified in § 413.40(c)(3) for the subject cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment for inpatient operating costs.</E> For cost reporting periods subject to this section, the hospital's Medicare allowable net inpatient operating costs for that period (as defined at § 413.40(a)(3)) are paid on a reasonable cost basis, subject to that hospital's ceiling (as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) for that period.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment for inpatient capital-related costs.</E> Medicare allowable net inpatient capital costs are paid on a reasonable cost basis, in accordance with the regulations under Part 413 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Adjustments for extraordinary circumstances</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (A) CMS may adjust the ceiling determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for one or more cost reporting periods when unusual inpatient operating costs have resulted in the hospital exceeding its ceiling imposed under this section due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, strikes, fire, earthquakes, floods, or similar unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects.</P>

        <P>(B) When the hospital requests an adjustment, CMS makes an adjustment only to the extent that the hospital's operating costs are reasonable, attributable to the circumstances specified separately, identified by the hospital, <PRTPAGE P="738"/>and verified by the Medicare administrative contractor.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Process for adjustment requests.</E> The provisions of §§ 413.40(e)(1) through (e)(5) of this subchapter are applicable to extraordinary circumstances adjustment requests under this section.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Special payment provision for short-stay outliers.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Short-stay outlier defined.</E> “Short-stay outlier” means a discharge with a covered length of stay in a long-term care hospital that is up to and including five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay for each LTC-DRG.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjustment to payment.</E> CMS adjusts the hospital's Federal prospective payment to account for any case that is determined to be a short-stay outlier, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, under the methodology specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Method for determining the payment amount</E>—(1) <E T="03">Discharges occurring before July 1, 2006.</E> For discharges from long-term care hospitals described under § 412.23(e)(2)(i), occurring before July 1, 2006, the LTCH prospective payment system adjusted payment amount for a short-stay outlier case is the least of the following amounts:</P>
        <P>(i) One hundred and twenty (120) percent of the LTC-DRG specific per diem amount determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) One hundred and twenty (120) percent of the estimated cost of the case determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) The Federal prospective payment for the LTC-DRG determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2006 and before July 1, 2007 and discharges occurring on or after December 29, 2007 and before December 29, 2012.</E> For discharges from long-term care hospitals described under § 412.23(e)(2)(i) occurring on or after July 1, 2006 and before July 1, 2007 and discharges occurring on or after December 29, 2007 and before December 29, 2012, the LTCH prospective payment system adjusted payment amount for a short-stay outlier case is the least of the following amounts:</P>
        <P>(i) One hundred and twenty (120) percent of the LTC-DRG specific per diem amount determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) One hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of the case determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iii) The Federal prospective payment for the LTC-DRG as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iv) An amount payable under subpart O computed as a blend of an amount comparable to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system per diem amount determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section and the 120 percent of the LTC-DRG specific per diem payment amount determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(A) The blend percentage applicable to the 120 percent of the LTC-DRG specific per diem payment amount determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is determined by dividing the covered length-of-stay of the case by the lesser of five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay of the LTC-DRG or 25 days, not to exceed 100 percent.</P>
        <P>(B) The blend percentage of the amount determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section is determined by subtracting the percentage determined in paragraph (A) from 100 percent.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2007 and before December 29, 2007 and discharges occurring on or after December 29, 2012 and on or before September 30, 2017.</E> For discharges from long-term care hospitals described under § 412.23(e)(2)(i) occurring on or after July 1, 2007, and on or before December 29, 2007 and discharges occurring on or after December 29, 2012, and on or before September 30, 2017, the LTCH prospective payment system adjusted payment amount for a short-stay outlier case is adjusted by either of the following:</P>

        <P>(i) If the covered length of stay of the case assigned to a particular LTC-DRG is less than or equal to one standard deviation from the geometric ALOS of the same DRG under the inpatient prospective payment system (the IPPS-<PRTPAGE P="739"/>comparable threshold), the LTCH prospective payment system adjusted payment amount for such a case is the least of the following amounts:</P>
        <P>(A) One hundred and twenty (120) percent of the LTC-DRG specific per diem amount determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
        <P>(B) One hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of the case determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(C) The Federal prospective payment for the LTC-DRG as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(D) An amount payable under subpart O of this part comparable to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system per diem amount determined under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) If the covered length of stay of the case assigned to a particular LTC-DRG is greater than one standard deviation from the geometric ALOS of the same DRG under the inpatient prospective payment system (the IPPS-comparable threshold), the LTCH prospective payment system adjusted payment amount for such a case is determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2017.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2017, short-stay outlier payments are determined according to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculation of alternative payment amounts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Determining the LTC-DRG per diem amount.</E> CMS calculates the LTC-DRG per diem amount for short-stay outliers for each LTC-DRG by dividing the product of the standard Federal payment rate and the LTC-DRG relative weight by the geometric average length of stay of the specific LTC-DRG multiplied by the covered days of the stay.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining the estimated cost of a case.</E> To determine the estimated cost of a case, CMS multiplies the hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio by the Medicare allowable charges for the case.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Determining the Federal prospective payment for the LTC-DRG.</E> CMS calculates the Federal prospective payment for the LTC-DRG by multiplying the adjusted standard Federal payment rate by the LTC-DRG relative weight.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Determining the amount comparable to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system per diem amount</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Under subpart O, CMS calculates—</P>
        <P>(A) An amount comparable to what would otherwise be paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system based on the sum of the applicable operating inpatient prospective payment system standardized amount and the capital inpatient prospective payment system Federal rate in effect at the time of the LTCH discharge.</P>
        <P>(B) An amount comparable to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system per diem amount for each DRG that is determined by dividing the amount that would otherwise be paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system computed under paragraph (A) of this section by the hospital inpatient prospective payment system geometric average length of stay of the specific DRG multiplied by the covered days of the stay.</P>
        <P>(C) The payment amount specified under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section may not exceed the full amount comparable to what would otherwise be paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Hospital inpatient prospective payment system operating standardized amount.</E> The hospital inpatient prospective payment system operating standardized amount—</P>
        <P>(A) Is adjusted for the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system DRG weighting factors.</P>
        <P>(B) Is adjusted for different area wage levels based on the geographic classifications set forth at § 412.503 and the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system labor-related share, using the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system wage index value for nonreclassified hospitals. For LTCHs located in Alaska and Hawaii, this amount is also adjusted by the applicable hospital inpatient prospective payment system cost of living adjustment factors.</P>

        <P>(C) Includes, where applicable, adjustments for indirect medical education costs and the costs of serving a <PRTPAGE P="740"/>disproportionate share of low-income patients.</P>

        <P>(4) <E T="03">Discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006, short-stay outlier payments are subject to the following provisions:</P>
        <P>(i) CMS may specify an alternative to the cost-to-charge ratio otherwise applicable under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. A hospital may also request that its fiscal intermediary use a different (higher or lower) cost-to-charge ratio based on substantial evidence presented by the hospital. This request must be approved by the appropriate CMS Regional Office.</P>
        <P>(ii) The cost-to-charge ratio applied at the time a claim is processed is based on either the most recent settled cost report or the most recent tentatively settled cost report, whichever is from the latest cost reporting period.</P>
        <P>(iii) The fiscal intermediary may use a statewide average cost-to-charge ratio, which CMS establishes annually, if it is unable to determine an accurate cost-to-charge ratio for a hospital in one of the following circumstances:</P>
        <P>(A) A new hospital that has not yet submitted its first Medicare cost report. (For this purpose, a new hospital is defined as an entity that has not accepted assignment of an existing hospital's provider agreement in accordance with § 489.18 of this chapter.)</P>
        <P>(B) A hospital whose cost-to-charge ratio is in excess of 3 standard deviations above the corresponding national geometric mean. CMS establishes and publishes this mean annually.</P>
        <P>(C) Any other hospital for which data to calculate a cost-to-charge ratio are not available.</P>
        <P>(iv) Any reconciliation of outlier payments is based on the cost-to-charge ratio calculated based on a ratio of costs to charges computed from the relevant cost report and charge data determined at the time the cost report coinciding with the discharge is settled.</P>
        <P>(v) At the time of any reconciliation under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, outlier payments may be adjusted to account for the time value of any underpayments or overpayments. Any adjustment is based upon a widely available index to be established in advance by the Secretary, and is applied from the midpoint of the cost reporting period to the date of reconciliation.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, long-term care hospitals receive payment under this subpart for inpatient operating costs and capital-related costs for each discharge only following submission of a discharge bill.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Periodic interim payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria for receiving periodic interim payments.</E> (i) A long-term care hospital receiving payment under this subpart may receive periodic interim payments (PIP) for Part A services under the PIP method subject to the provisions of § 413.64(h) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) To be approved for PIP, the long-term care hospital must meet the qualifying requirements in § 413.64(h)(3) of this subchapter.</P>

        <P>(iii) As provided in § 413.64(h)(5) of this subchapter, intermediary approval is conditioned upon the intermediary's best judgment as to whether payment can be made under the PIP method <PRTPAGE P="754"/>without undue risk of the PIP resulting in an overpayment to the provider.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Frequency of payment.</E> (i) For long-term care hospitals approved for PIP and paid solely under Federal prospective payment system rates under §§ 412.533(a)(5) and 412.533(c), the intermediary estimates the long-term care hospital's Federal prospective payments net after estimated beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount of payment for the year.</P>
        <P>(ii) For long-term care hospitals approved for PIP and paid using the blended payment schedule specified in § 412.533(a) for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, and before October 1, 2006, the intermediary estimates the hospital's portion of the Federal prospective payments net and the hospital's portion of the reasonable cost-based reimbursement payments net, after beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance, in accordance with the blended transition percentages specified in § 412.533(a), and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount of both portions of payments for the year.</P>
        <P>(iii) If the long-term care hospital has payment experience under the long-term care hospital prospective payment system, the intermediary estimates PIP based on that payment experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by substantiated information for the current year.</P>
        <P>(iv) Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as described in § 413.64(h)(6) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(v) The interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if a hospital receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are subject to final settlement.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Termination of PIP.</E> (i) <E T="03">Request by the hospital.</E> Subject to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, a long-term care hospital receiving PIP may convert to receiving prospective payments on a non-PIP basis at any time.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Removal by the intermediary.</E> An intermediary terminates PIP if the long-term care hospital no longer meets the requirements of § 413.64(h) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim payments for Medicare bad debts and for Part A costs not paid under the prospective payment system.</E> For Medicare bad debts and for the costs of an approved education program, blood clotting factors, anesthesia services furnished by hospital-employed nonphysician anesthetists or obtained under arrangement, and photocopying and mailing medical records to a QIO, which are costs paid outside the prospective payment system, the intermediary determines the interim payments by estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the previous year's experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by substantiated information for the current year, and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount. Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of the biweekly period of service as described in § 413.64(h)(6) of this subchapter. The interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if a long-term care hospital receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are subject to final cost settlement.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Special interim payment for unusually long lengths of stay</E>—(1) <E T="03">First interim payment.</E> A hospital that is not receiving periodic interim payments under paragraph (b) of this section may request an interim payment 60 days after a Medicare beneficiary has been admitted to the hospital. Payment for the interim bill is determined as if the bill were a final discharge bill and includes any outlier payment determined as of the last day for which services have been billed.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Method of payment.</E> (1) Under the prospective payment system, inpatient rehabilitation facilities receive a predetermined amount per discharge for <PRTPAGE P="764"/>inpatient services furnished to Medicare Part A fee-for-service beneficiaries.</P>
        <P>(2) The amount of payment under the prospective payment system is based on the Federal payment rate, including adjustments described in § 412.624 and, if applicable, during a transition period, on a blend of the Federal payment rate and the facility-specific payment rate described in § 412.626.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">IRF coverage criteria.</E> In order for an IRF claim to be considered reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act, there must be a reasonable expectation that the patient meets all of the following requirements at the time of the patient's admission to the IRF—</P>
        <P>(i) Requires the active and ongoing therapeutic intervention of multiple therapy disciplines (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, or prosthetics/orthotics therapy), one of which must be physical or occupational therapy.</P>
        <P>(ii) Generally requires and can reasonably be expected to actively participate in, and benefit from, an intensive rehabilitation therapy program. Under current industry standards, this intensive rehabilitation therapy program generally consists of at least 3 hours of therapy (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, or prosthetics/orthotics therapy) per day at least 5 days per week. In certain well-documented cases, this intensive rehabilitation therapy program might instead consist of at least 15 hours of intensive rehabilitation therapy within a 7 consecutive day period, beginning with the date of admission to the IRF. Benefit from this intensive rehabilitation therapy program is demonstrated by measurable improvement that will be of practical value to the patient in improving the patient's functional capacity or adaptation to impairments. The required therapy treatments must begin within 36 hours from midnight of the day of admission to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(iii) Is sufficiently stable at the time of admission to the IRF to be able to actively participate in the intensive rehabilitation therapy program that is described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
        <P>(iv) Requires physician supervision by a rehabilitation physician. The requirement for medical supervision means that the rehabilitation physician must conduct face-to-face visits with the patient at least 3 days per week throughout the patient's stay in the IRF to assess the patient both medically and functionally, as well as to modify the course of treatment as needed to maximize the patient's capacity to benefit from the rehabilitation process. The post-admission physician evaluation described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section may count as one of the face-to-face visits.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> To document that each patient for whom the IRF seeks payment is reasonably expected to meet all of the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section at the time of admission, the patient's medical record at the IRF must contain the following documentation—</P>
        <P>(i) A comprehensive preadmission screening that meets all of the following requirements—</P>
        <P>(A) It is conducted by a licensed or certified clinician(s) designated by a rehabilitation physician within the 48 hours immediately preceding the IRF admission. A preadmission screening that includes all of the required elements, but that is conducted more than 48 hours immediately preceding the IRF admission, will be accepted as long as an update is conducted in person or by telephone to update the patient's medical and functional status within the 48 hours immediately preceding the IRF admission and is documented in the patient's medical record.</P>
        <P>(B) It includes a detailed and comprehensive review of each patient's condition and medical history.</P>
        <P>(C) It serves as the basis for the initial determination of whether or not the patient meets the requirements for an IRF admission to be considered reasonable and necessary in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(D) It is used to inform a rehabilitation physician who reviews and documents his or her concurrence with the findings and results of the preadmission screening.</P>

        <P>(E) It is retained in the patient's medical record at the IRF.<PRTPAGE P="765"/>

        <P>(A) It is completed by a rehabilitation physician within 24 hours of the patient's admission to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(B) It documents the patient's status on admission to the IRF, includes a comparison with the information noted in the preadmission screening documentation, and serves as the basis for the development of the overall individualized plan of care.</P>
        <P>(C) It is retained in the patient's medical record at the IRF.</P>
        <P>(iii) An individualized overall plan of care for the patient that meets all of the following requirements—</P>
        <P>(A) It is developed by a rehabilitation physician with input from the interdisciplinary team within 4 days of the patient's admission to the IRF.</P>
        <P>(B) It is retained in the patient's medical record at the IRF.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Interdisciplinary team approach to care.</E> In order for an IRF claim to be considered reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act, the patient must require an interdisciplinary team approach to care, as evidenced by documentation in the patient's medical record of weekly interdisciplinary team meetings that meet all of the following requirements—</P>
        <P>(i) The team meetings are led by a rehabilitation physician and further consist of a registered nurse with specialized training or experience in rehabilitation; a social worker or case manager (or both); and a licensed or certified therapist from each therapy discipline involved in treating the patient. All team members must have current knowledge of the patient's medical and functional status. The rehabilitation physician may lead the interdisciplinary team meeting remotely via a mode of communication such as video or telephone conferencing.</P>
        <P>(ii) The team meetings occur at least once per week throughout the duration of the patient's stay to implement appropriate treatment services; review the patient's progress toward stated rehabilitation goals; identify any problems that could impede progress towards those goals; and, where necessary, reassess previously established goals in light of impediments, revise the treatment plan in light of new goals, and monitor continued progress toward those goals.</P>
        <P>(iii) The results and findings of the team meetings, and the concurrence by the rehabilitation physician with those results and findings, are retained in the patient's medical record.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment in full.</E> (1) The payment made under this subpart represents payment in full (subject to applicable deductibles and coinsurance as described in subpart G of part 409 of this subchapter) for inpatient operating and capital-related costs associated with furnishing Medicare covered services in an inpatient rehabilitation facility, but not for the cost of an approved medical education program described in §§ 413.75 and 413.85 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(2) In addition to payments based on prospective payment rates, inpatient rehabilitation facilities receive payments for the following:</P>
        <P>(i) Bad debts of Medicare beneficiaries, as provided in § 413.80 of this chapter; and</P>
        <P>(ii) A payment amount per unit for blood clotting factor provided to Medicare inpatients who have hemophilia.</P>

        <P>(a) <E T="03">Data used.</E> To calculate the prospective payment rates for inpatient hospital services furnished by inpatient rehabilitation facilities, we use—</P>
        <P>(1) The most recent Medicare data available, as of the date of establishing the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system, to estimate payments for inpatient operating and capital-related costs made under part 413 of this subchapter;</P>

        <P>(2) An appropriate wage index to adjust for area wage differences;<PRTPAGE P="766"/>
        </P>
        <P>(3) An increase factor to adjust for the most recent estimate of increases in the prices of an appropriate market basket of goods and services included in covered inpatient rehabilitation services; and</P>
        <P>(4) Patient assessment data described in § 412.606 and other data that account for the relative resource utilization of different patient types.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining the average costs per discharge for fiscal year 2001.</E> We determine the average inpatient operating and capital costs per discharge for which payment is made to each inpatient rehabilitation facility using the available data specified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The cost per discharge is adjusted to fiscal year 2001 by an increase factor, described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, under the update methodology described in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act for each year through the midpoint of fiscal year 2001.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the Federal prospective payment rates</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Federal prospective payment rates will be established using a standard payment amount referred to as the standard payment conversion factor. The standard payment conversion factor is a standardized payment amount based on average costs from a base year that reflects the combined aggregate effects of the weighting factors, various facility and case level adjustments, and other adjustments.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Update the cost per discharge.</E> CMS applies the increase factor described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the facility's cost per discharge determined under paragraph (b) of this section to compute the cost per discharge for fiscal year 2002. Based on the updated cost per discharge, CMS estimates the payments that would have been made to the facility for fiscal year 2002 under part 413 of this chapter without regard to the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Computation of the standard payment conversion factor.</E> The standard payment conversion factor is computed as follows:</P>
        <P>(i) <E T="03">For fiscal year 2002.</E> Based on the updated costs per discharge and estimated payments for fiscal year 2002 determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, CMS computes a standard payment conversion factor for fiscal year 2002, as specified by CMS, that reflects, as appropriate, the adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">For fiscal years after 2002.</E> The standard payment conversion factor for fiscal years after 2002 will be the standardized payments for the previous fiscal year updated by the increase factor described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, including adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section as appropriate.</P>
        <P>(4) Applicable increase factor for FY 2014 and for subsequent FY. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the applicable increase factor for FY 2014 and for subsequent years for updating the standard payment conversion factor is the increase factor described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, including adjustments described in paragraph (d) of this section as appropriate.</P>
        <P>(i) In the case of an IRF that is paid under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(3) that does not submit quality data to CMS in accordance with § 412.634, the applicable increase factor specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, after application of subparagraphs (C)(iii) and (D) of section 1886(j)(3) of the Act, is reduced by 2 percentage points.</P>
        <P>(ii) Any reduction of the increase factor will apply only to the fiscal year involved and will not be taken into account in computing the applicable increase factor for a subsequent fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(iii) The 2 percentage point reduction described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section may result in the applicable increase factor specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section being less than 0.0 for a fiscal year, and may result in payment rates under the prospective payment system specified in § 412.1(a)(3) for a fiscal year being less than such payment rates for the preceding fiscal year.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Determining the Federal prospective payment rate for each case-mix group.</E> The Federal prospective payment rates for each case-mix group is the product of the weighting factors described in § 412.620(b) and the standard payment <PRTPAGE P="767"/>conversion factor described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustments to the standard payment conversion factor.</E> The standard payment conversion factor described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be adjusted for the following:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Outlier payments.</E> CMS determines a reduction factor equal to the estimated proportion of additional outlier payments described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Budget neutrality.</E> CMS adjusts the Federal prospective payment rates for fiscal year 2002 so that aggregate payments under the prospective payment system, excluding any additional payments associated with elections not to be paid under the transition period methodology under § 412.626(b), are estimated to equal the amount that would have been made to inpatient rehabilitation facilities under part 413 of this chapter without regard to the prospective payment system implemented under this subpart.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Coding and classification changes.</E> CMS adjusts the standard payment conversion factor for a given year if CMS determines that revisions in case-mix classifications or weighting factors for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that those revisions for a future fiscal year) did result in (or would otherwise result in) a change in aggregate payments that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of patients that do not reflect real changes in case-mix.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment adjustment for Federal fiscal year 2006 and applicable Federal fiscal years.</E> CMS adjusts the standard payment conversion factor based on any updates to the adjustments specified in paragraph (e)(2), (3), (4) and (6), of this section, and to any revision specified in § 412.620(c) by a factor as specified by the Secretary.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculation of the adjusted Federal prospective payment.</E> For each discharge, an inpatient rehabilitation facility's Federal prospective payment is computed on the basis of the Federal prospective payment rate that is in effect for its cost reporting period that begins in a Federal fiscal year specified under paragraph (c) of this section. A facility's Federal prospective payment rate will be adjusted, as appropriate, to account for area wage levels, payments for outliers and transfers, and for other factors as follows:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Adjustment for area wage levels.</E> The labor portion of a facility's Federal prospective payment is adjusted to account for geographical differences in the area wage levels using an appropriate wage index. The application of the wage index is made on the basis of the location of the facility in an urban or rural area as defined in § 412.602. Adjustments or updates to the wage data used to adjust a facility's Federal prospective payment rate under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be made in a budget neutral manner. CMS determines a budget neutral wage adjustment factor, based on any adjustment or update to the wage data, to apply to the standard payment conversion factor.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjustments for low-income patients.</E> We adjust the Federal prospective payment, on a facility basis, for the proportion of low-income patients that receive inpatient rehabilitation services as determined by us.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjustments for rural areas.</E> We adjust the Federal prospective payment by a factor, as specified by us for facilities located in rural areas, as defined in § 412.602.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Adjustments for teaching hospitals.</E> For discharges on or after October 1, 2005, CMS adjusts the Federal prospective payment on a facility basis by a factor as specified by CMS for facilities that are teaching institutions or units of teaching institutions. This adjustment is made on a claim basis as an interim payment and the final payment in full for the claim is made during the final settlement of the cost report.</P>
        <P>(5) <E T="03">Adjustment for high-cost outliers.</E> CMS provides for an additional payment to an inpatient rehabilitation facility if its estimated costs for a patient exceed a fixed dollar amount (adjusted for area wage levels and factors to account for treating low-income patients, for rural location, and for teaching programs) as specified by CMS. The additional payment equals 80 percent of the difference between the estimated cost of the patient and the sum of the adjusted Federal prospective payment computed under this section and the adjusted fixed dollar <PRTPAGE P="768"/>amount. Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2003, additional payments made under this section will be subject to the adjustments at § 412.84(i), except that CMS calculates a single overall (combined operating and capital) cost-to-charge ratio and national averages that will be used instead of statewide averages. Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2003, additional payments made under this section will also be subject to adjustments at § 412.84(m), except that CMS calculates a single overall (combined operating and capital) cost-to-charge ratio.</P>
        <P>(6) <E T="03">Adjustments for certain facilities geographically redesignated in FY 2006</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> For a facility defined as an urban facility under § 412.602 in FY 2006 that was previously defined as a rural facility in FY 2005 as the term rural was defined in FY 2005 under § 412.602 and whose payment, after applying the adjustment under this paragraph, will be lower only because of being defined as an urban facility in FY 2006 and it no longer qualified for the rural adjustment under § 412.624(e)(3) in FY 2006, CMS will adjust the facility's payment using the following method:</P>
        <P>(A) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, and on or before September 30, 2006, the facility's payment will be increased by an adjustment of two thirds of its prior FY 2005 19.14 percent rural adjustment.</P>
        <P>(B) For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006, and on or before September 30, 2007, the facility's payment will be increased by an adjustment of one third of its FY 2005 19.14 percent rural adjustment.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005 and on or before September 30, 2007, facilities whose payments, after applying the adjustment under this paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, will be higher because of being defined as an urban facility in FY 2006 and no longer being qualified for the rural adjustment under § 412.624(e)(3) in FY 2006, CMS will adjust the facility's payment by a portion of the applicable additional adjustment described in paragraph (e)(6)(i)(A) and (B) of this section as determined by us.</P>
        <P>(f) <E T="03">Special payment provision for patients that are transferred.</E> (1) A facility's Federal prospective payment will be adjusted to account for a discharge of a patient who—</P>
        <P>(i) Is transferred from the inpatient rehabilitation facility to another site of care, as defined in § 412.602; and</P>
        <P>(ii) Stays in the facility for a number of days that is less than the average length of stay for nontransfer cases in the case-mix group to which the patient is classified.</P>
        <P>(2) We calculate the adjusted Federal prospective payment for patients who are transferred in the following manner:</P>
        <P>(i) By dividing the Federal prospective payment by the average length of stay for nontransfer cases in the case-mix group to which the patient is classified to equal the payment per day.</P>
        <P>(ii) By multiplying the payment per day under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section by the number of days the patient stayed in the facility prior to being discharged to equal the per day payment amount.</P>
        <P>(iii) By multiplying the payment per day under paragraph (f)(2)(i) by 0.5 to equal an additional one half day payment for the first day of the stay before the discharge.</P>
        <P>(iv) By adding the per day payment amount under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) and the additional one-half day payment under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) to equal the unadjusted payment amount.</P>
        <P>(v) By applying the adjustment described in paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (6) of this section to the unadjusted payment amount determined in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section to equal the adjusted transfer payment amount and making a payment in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section, if applicable.</P>
        <P>(g) <E T="03">Special payment provision for interrupted stays.</E> When a patient in an inpatient rehabilitation facility has one or more interruptions in the stay, as defined in § 412.602 and as indicated on the patient assessment instrument in accordance with § 412.618(b), we will make payments in the following manner:</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">Patient is discharged and returns on the same day.</E> Payment for a patient who is discharged and returns to the same inpatient rehabilitation facility on the same day will be the adjusted Federal prospective payment under <PRTPAGE P="769"/>paragraph (e) of this section that is based on the patient assessment data specified in § 412.618(a)(1). Payment for a patient who is discharged and returns to the same inpatient rehabilitation facility on the same day will only be made to the inpatient rehabilitation facility.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Patient is discharged and does not return by the end of the same day.</E> Payment for a patient who is discharged and does not return on the same day but does return to the same inpatient rehabilitation facility by or on midnight of the third day, defined as an interrupted stay under § 412.602, will be—</P>
        <P>(i) The adjusted Federal prospective payment under paragraph (e) of this section that is based on the patient assessment data specified in § 412.618(a)(1) made to the inpatient rehabilitation facility; and</P>
        <P>(ii) If the reason for the interrupted patient stay is to receive inpatient acute care hospital services, an amount based on the prospective payment systems described in § 412.1(a)(1) made to the acute care hospital.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Transition period.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Duration of transition period and proportion of the blended transition rate.</E> (1) Except for a facility that makes an election under paragraph (b) of this section, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002 and before October 1, 2002, an inpatient rehabilitation facility receives a payment comprised of a blend of the adjusted Federal prospective payment, as determined under § 412.624(e) or § 412.624(f) and a facility-specific payment as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
        <P>(i) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002 and before October 1, 2002, payment is based on 33<FR>1/3</FR> percent of the facility-specific payment and 66<FR>2/3</FR> percent of the adjusted FY 2002 Federal prospective payment.</P>
        <P>(ii) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, payment is based entirely on the adjusted Federal prospective payment.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Calculation of the facility-specific payment.</E> The facility-specific payment is equal to the payment for each cost reporting period in the transition period that would have been made without regard to this subpart. The facility's Medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the facility-specific payment for inpatient operating costs and capital-related costs in accordance with part 413 of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Election not to be paid under the transition period methodology.</E> An inpatient rehabilitation facility may elect a payment that is based entirely on the adjusted Federal prospective payment for cost reporting periods beginning before fiscal year 2003 without regard to the transition period percentages specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
        <P>(1) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> An inpatient rehabilitation facility will be required to request the election under this paragraph (b) within 30 days of its first cost reporting period for which payment is based on the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002 and before October 1, 2002.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification requirement to make election.</E> The request by the inpatient rehabilitation facility to make the election under this paragraph (b) must be made in writing to the Medicare fiscal intermediary. The intermediary must receive the request on or before the 30th day before the applicable cost reporting period begins, regardless of any postmarks or anticipated delivery dates. Requests received, postmarked, or delivered by other means after the 30th day before the cost reporting period begins will not be approved. If the 30th day before the cost reporting period begins falls on a day that the postal service or other delivery sources are not open for business, the inpatient rehabilitation facility is responsible for allowing sufficient time for the delivery of the request before the deadline. If an inpatient rehabilitation facility's request is not received timely or is otherwise not approved, payment will be based on the transition period rate <PRTPAGE P="770"/>specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Method of payment under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an inpatient rehabilitation facility receives payment under this subpart for inpatient operating costs and capital-related costs for each discharge only following submission of a discharge bill.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Periodic interim payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria for receiving periodic interim payments.</E> (i) An inpatient rehabilitation facility receiving payment under this subpart may receive periodic interim payments (PIP) for Part A services under the PIP method subject to the provisions of § 413.64(h) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(ii) To be approved for PIP, the inpatient rehabilitation facility must meet the qualifying requirements in § 413.64(h)(3) of this subchapter.</P>
        <P>(iii) Payments to a rehabilitation unit are made under the same method of payment as the hospital of which it is a part as described in § 412.116.</P>
        <P>(iv) As provided in § 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter, intermediary approval is conditioned upon the intermediary's best judgment as to whether payment can be made under the PIP method without undue risk of its resulting in an overpayment to the provider.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Frequency of payment.</E> For facilities approved for PIP, the intermediary estimates the inpatient rehabilitation facility's Federal prospective payments net of estimated beneficiary deductibles and coinsurance and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount of payment for the year. If the inpatient rehabilitation facility has payment experience under the prospective payment system, the intermediary estimates PIP based on that payment experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by substantiated information for the current year. Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as described in § 413.64(h)(6) of this subchapter. The interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if an inpatient rehabilitation facility receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are subject to final settlement.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Termination of PIP.</E> (i) <E T="03">Request by the inpatient rehabilitation facility.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, an inpatient rehabilitation facility receiving PIP may convert to receiving prospective payments on a non-PIP basis at any time.</P>
        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Removal by the intermediary.</E> An intermediary terminates PIP if the inpatient rehabilitation facility no longer meets the requirements of § 413.64(h) of this chapter.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim payments for Medicare bad debts and for Part A costs not paid under the prospective payment system.</E> For Medicare bad debts and for costs of an approved education program and other <PRTPAGE P="771"/>costs paid outside the prospective payment system, the intermediary determines the interim payments by estimating the reimbursable amount for the year based on the previous year's experience, adjusted for projected changes supported by substantiated information for the current year, and makes biweekly payments equal to <FR>1/26</FR> of the total estimated amount. Each payment is made 2 weeks after the end of a biweekly period of service as described in § 413.64(h)(6) of this chapter. The interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if an inpatient rehabilitation facility receives interim payments for less than a full reporting period. These payments are subject to final cost settlement.</P>
        <P>(d) <E T="03">Outlier payments.</E> Additional payments for outliers are not made on an interim basis. The outlier payments are made based on the submission of a discharge bill and represent final payment.</P>
        <P>(e) <E T="03">Accelerated payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Upon request, an accelerated payment may be made to an inpatient rehabilitation facility that is receiving payment under this subpart and is not receiving PIP under paragraph (b) of this section if the inpatient rehabilitation facility is experiencing financial difficulties because of the following:</P>
        <P>(i) There is a delay by the intermediary in making payment to the inpatient rehabilitation facility.</P>
        <P>(ii) Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in the inpatient rehabilitation facility's preparation and submittal of bills to the intermediary beyond its normal billing cycle.</P>
        <P>(2) <E T="03">Approval of payment.</E> An inpatient rehabilitation facility's request for an accelerated payment must be approved by the intermediary and us.</P>
        <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of payment.</E> The amount of the accelerated payment is computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid covered services.</P>
        <P>(4) <E T="03">Recovery of payment.</E> Recovery of the accelerated payment is made by recoupment as inpatient rehabilitation facility bills are processed or by direct payment by the inpatient rehabilitation facility.</P>
